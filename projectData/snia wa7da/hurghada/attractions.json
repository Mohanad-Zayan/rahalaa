The staff where also giving the larger tortoises to people to hold, I didn't really like this either.

As this is the largest aquarium in Africa and built in recent years, I expected animal welfare to be paramount. I thought the days of animals in small enclosures were long gone. There are too many fish in the tanks and the enclosures way too small for the animals in the small zoo. There does not appear to be anything in the enclosures to stimulate the animals and the water in ALL the tanks was very murky & dirty. A diver in the main aquarium that has sharks and stingrays teased them with a fish so the tourists could get a better camera shot. The whole aquarium is already quite run down & dirty. And to top it off, the admission is £30 EACH!!! I had a day trip to Luxor for £60 which included admission to the main ancient sites and lunch. Much, much better value and didn't leave me feeling guilty for having fallen for the hype on the aquarium website!

There were around 60 people waiting in line, because everyone had to go to that restaurant. Also during lunch the slides closed for 1 hour.\nDrinks were included, but for a beer they wanted an upcharge. No snacks, nothing except minimal lunch options.

The staff are genuinely sincere. The place is divided into three major activities beach club, cable surfing and sliders, which allow you to spend the whole day there without getting bored. I tried the sliders for half an hour and it was enough for a couple but if you have a larger gathering you will enjoy it more. I tried for the first time my surfing experience and it was amaaaaaazing although I though it will be so hard to enjoy it in 1 hour but the coach was good and the whole experience was so good. It a little bit pricey but for a place of a kind in el gouna I guess it worth it. I’ll pay it a visit again for sure.","publishedDate":"2019-09-03T10:46:32-04:00","rating":"5","travelDate":"2019-08","user":null,"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false}],"location":{"coordinates":["27.377665","33.660904"],"address":"Sabina Area, El Gouna, Hurghada 84512 Egypt"},"activities":["Water & Amusement Parks"],"activityDesctiptor":["Water Parks"],"numberOfReviews":"149"},{"type":"ATTRACTION","image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/4a/fa/25/marina-overview.jpg","location_id":"623675","name":"Abu Tig Marina","timezone":"Africa/Cairo","location_string":"El Gouna, Hurghada, Red Sea and Sinai","photo":{"images":{"small":{"width":"150","url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0f/4a/fa/25/marina-overview.jpg","height":"150"},"thumbnail":{"width":"50","url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0f/4a/fa/25/marina-overview.jpg","height":"50"},"original":{"width":"2000","url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/4a/fa/25/marina-overview.jpg","height":"1333"},"large":{"width":"1024","url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/0f/4a/fa/25/marina-overview.jpg","height":"682"},"medium":{"width":"550","url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0f/4a/fa/25/marina-overview.jpg","height":"367"}},"is_blessed":false,"uploaded_date":"2017-05-17T05:33:07-0400","caption":"Marina overview","id":"256571941","helpful_votes":"6","published_date":"2017-05-17T05:33:07-0400","user":{"user_id":null,"member_id":"0","type":"user"}},"api_detail_url":"https://api.tripadvisor.com/api/internal/1.14/location/623675","awards":[],"location_subtype":"none","doubleclick_zone":"af.egypt.red_sea_and_sinai.el_gouna","preferred_map_engine":"default","raw_ranking":"4.06787633895874","ranking_geo":"Hurghada","ranking_geo_id":"297549","ranking_position":"3","ranking_denominator":"55","ranking_category":"attraction","ranking_subcategory":"#3 of 55 things to do in Hurghada","subcategory_ranking":"#3 of 55 things to do in Hurghada","ranking":"#3 of 55 things to do in Hurghada","distance":null,"distance_string":null,"bearing":null,"rating":"4.5","is_closed":false,"is_long_closed":false,"description":"","web_url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297548-d623675-Reviews-Abu_Tig_Marina-El_Gouna_Hurghada_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html","write_review":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/UserReview-g297548-d623675-Abu_Tig_Marina-El_Gouna_Hurghada_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html","ancestors":[{"subcategory":[{"key":"city","name":"City"}],"name":"El Gouna","abbrv":null,"location_id":"297548"},{"subcategory":[{"key":"municipality","name":"Municipality"}],"name":"Hurghada","abbrv":null,"location_id":"297549"},{"subcategory":[{"key":"region","name":"Region"}],"name":"Red Sea and Sinai","abbrv":null,"location_id":"297545"},{"subcategory":[{"key":"country","name":"Country"}],"name":"Egypt","abbrv":null,"location_id":"294200"}],"category":{"key":"attraction","name":"Attraction"},"parent_display_name":"El Gouna","is_jfy_enabled":false,"nearest_metro_station":[],"phone":"+20 65 3580073","website":"http://abutig-marina.com/","email":"info@abutig-marina.com","address_obj":{"street1":"","street2":"","city":"El Gouna","state":null,"country":"Egypt","postalcode":""},"is_candidate_for_contact_info_suppression":false,"booking":{"provider":"Viator","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Commerce?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.viator.com%2Ftours%2FHurghada%2F5-HOURS-TO-DOLPHIN-HOUSE-WITH-A-PRIVATE-BOAT%2Fd800-111672P3%3Feap%3Dtripadvisor-main-11383%26aid%3Dtripen1&partnerKey=1&urlKey=de52a40308aac2a59&logme=true&uidparam=refid&attrc=true&Provider=Viator&area=TOP&slot=1&cnt=1&geo=623675&clt=TD&from=api&nt=true"},"offer_group":{"lowest_price":"$0.54","offer_list":[{"url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Commerce?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.viator.com%2Ftours%2FHurghada%2F5-HOURS-TO-DOLPHIN-HOUSE-WITH-A-PRIVATE-BOAT%2Fd800-111672P3%3Feap%3Dtripadvisor-main-11383%26aid%3Dtripen1&partnerKey=1&urlKey=de52a40308aac2a59&logme=true&uidparam=refid&attrc=true&Provider=Viator&area=viator_multi&slot=1&cnt=1&geo=623675&clt=TD&from=api&nt=true","price":"$211.12","rounded_up_price":"$212","offer_type":"","title":"PRIVATE!

It also helps to have a restaurant reservation I understand. We hadn’t done that either. I love the fact that it is purpose built and immaculate. I’d read that the prices were high for meals. It might be more expensive here than other areas of Egypt but as British tourists we are used to paying these prices and much higher in parts of Europe.  It was very quiet so did lack a bit of ambience but I think most people take a later lunch here. Everyone was friendly and we enjoyed a Tuk Tuk ride to the main gate where we were meeting our driver.

It was very difficult to film or photograph anything as you were constantly called to move on as limited time. I'd have preferred to cover less distance and given more time to look. The food included for lunch was really good. Selection of meat, chicken, pasta, rice and salads. Our return boat trip back was great fun.

The food in all of the restaurants is very high quality. With 5 restaurants to choose from you will not be stuck with the usual bad food that you often get at all inclusive holidays. The Lebanese restaurant was a firm favourite for us, but the others are all high end. The service throughout the hotel is outstanding. We were well looked after throughout our stay, by very attentive staff. The animation team are a great bunch, providing fun and games especially Kareem whose energy is endless and addictive. The spa team do a good job, although some of the treatments are a little pricey. Ther excursion team were great and having done some research beforehand we were impressed by the cost of these. Monsour really did look after our needs and ensured we did the things that really interested us.\nThe only think that let's this resort down is the drinks/bar. There is very little choice of soft drinks or alcohol. Soft drink choice is sprite coke or squash! There are no menus in any of the bars. The quality of alcohol is very poor and the team are not trained in mixing drinks, so there is no consistency. We had to go off site to get a decent drink. Please, please fix this so you can be the perfect place.","publishedDate":"2023-01-15T06:13:44-05:00","rating":"4","travelDate":"2023-01","user":null,"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"Amazing hotel like paradise","text":"We stayed here early December for 8 days.\nThe hotel is only 15m.from airport.\nThe service in hotel was fantastic.\nI thought it would be good when I booked , but it was excellent.\nThe main buffet restaurant was very good and had a large selection.\nStaff , security were all professional and friendly.\nI really recommend it.","publishedDate":"2023-01-03T08:55:38-05:00","rating":"5","travelDate":"2022-12","user":null,"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"Amazing","text":"It was great holiday with my friends and i really like theis place and also the aqua park it so nice and also the animation team it was really active and great","publishedDate":"2022-12-22T21:32:53-05:00","rating":"5","travelDate":"2022-12","user":null,"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"Amazing aqua park","text":"It’s wonderful and.

It was the first time for us. I have previously read travel reviews on the internet, where I found useful information. This way we got in touch with the manager of the local tourism agency Bon Voyage Tours Hurghada, Mr. Medo Fateem. A few days prior to our arrival, we contacted him via WhatsApp, so that everything was arranged in advance. We wanted to go on some local trips, so he was very kind and prompt to send us a price list (in Hurghada we realized that their prices are half compared to the other agencies).\nWe chose three trips, asked him to book us for them, and we met in front of our resort. He personally came to the meeting, handed us the tickets, and made sure we had all the information we needed. After each trip he contacted us, to make sure everything was ok. We were pleasantly surprised by his professionalism, hospitality and fairness.\nWe decided to go to Paradise Island, Glass Boat and Moto Safari, all with the transfer from the resort to the location included in the price.\nThe excursion to one of the islands, at Paradise beach, involved traveling by boat to the island, where we spent 4 amazing hours, in which we went snorkeling with the crew (they provided equipment),sunbathing, bath in the sea, and ate at the restaurant on the island (buffet). We watched on the island a traditional dance performance. The landscapes and colors are spectacular, the corals and fish are wonderful, very pleasant atmosphere the entire day.\nThe Glass Boat trip was done with a glass-walled ship, and you could enjoy the flora and fauna of the Red Sea, and a snorkeling session at the end.\nWe mostly enjoyed Moto Safari, where we drove ATVs through the desert, to the Bedouin village, we ride the camel, and we had a tea and a shisha with them.\nAll trips were more than affordable and we paid the right price for them, choosing the mentioned agency.\nWe intend to return to Egypt to visit the pyramids and the Valley of the Kings. We didn't have enough time for that.\nWe have spent many vacations in Greece, in different islands, but Egypt is special and unique, from many points of view.\nIt is a safe destination, despite the problems in the past, and I recommend you to go with all my heart!","publishedDate":"2019-10-09T06:27:00-04:00","rating":"5","travelDate":"2019-09","user":null,"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"Tee","text":"Camel riding is best and The Tee can t you buy and The horse riding and donkey is good for you children","publishedDate":"2019-07-02T21:33:45-04:00","rating":"5","travelDate":"2019-07","user":null,"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"a must","text":"exciting day tour food quad biking ,excellent full expernces. meeting the beduon, also riding camels","publishedDate":"2019-05-16T11:31:00-04:00","rating":"5","travelDate":"2019-05","user":null,"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"Desert","text":"Amazing day buggy riding and quad biking in the desert, most fun filled day spent in Hurghada, We booked on Viator, amazing Barbeque and show to end the Evening ","publishedDate":"2019-02-27T22:07:25-05:00","rating":"5","travelDate":"2018-03","user":null,"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"Amazing!","text":"Amazing quad biking and camel ride with the best tour guides and lovely locals, thoroughly recommend!","publishedDate":"2018-09-12T03:01:52-04:00","rating":"5","travelDate":"2018-08","user":null,"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"Not so good.","text":"We didn’t enjoy this trip. ridding quads with other 50 people , women with the kids in front drive very slow and everyone need to follow in the line. very boring. didn’t like to see how Egyptian children treat camels :(","publishedDate":"2018-09-02T03:16:39-04:00","rating":"3","travelDate":"2018-05","user":null,"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"Fantastic","text":"Great half day quad biking, visit to Bedouins, camel riding. . \nTake water, sunscreen,sunglasses and scarf if quad biking.

We came over from Hill Villas where we are staying, across the bridge and my wife and I crossed with no issue. Our 4 daughters were a minute or so behind us, we suddenly received a panicked call from them saying they were effectively “being detained” and couldn’t go any further. In addition, 1 hotel worker was then extremely rude, demanding they call us immediately and have us “hurry” back. We were already down the jetty when we got the call and came back as swiftly as we could but still these people harried our children into calling us and demanding we came back quicker. Once back were informed we were “breaking the rules” and ordered to pay 100LE each or leave!

For me, Hurghada museum is an institution that you should definitely not miss in this resort. A few basics before you dive into exploring artifacts from the history of Ancient Egypt, the Ptolemaic period to almost the present day. Don't be alarmed, the museum is on the first floor of the shopping center and is wheelchair accessible by elevator. When I was here on the 11/2022 tour, the opening hours were divided as follows: 10:00 - 13:00, 17:00 - 22:00. Another thing I would like to mention is the entrance fee, you can buy it in advance through the museum's website, but it will cost you more than on the spot. You can buy it in the museum for 200 EGP, and on the website for 350 EGP. ATTENTION! Payment for tickets is only possible in cash. In any case, student discounts are recognized and therefore ISIC with you. On the sidelines, I would also like to mention the local shopping arcade, the things here are of good quality and at fixed prices with a single cash register at the exit, cash and card payments are accepted here, unlike the museum, and if there  is something here that you will definitely not find in shops elsewhere, it is the Carina stand - a brand of cotton home clothes and linen at very reasonable prices.","publishedDate":"2022-11-26T07:46:18-05:00","rating":"5","travelDate":"2022-11","user":null,"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false}],"location":{"coordinates":["27.159456","33.821358"],"address":"Airport Road Mubarak 6, Hurghada 84511 Egypt"},"activities":["Museums"],"activityDesctiptor":["History Museums","Art Museums"],"numberOfReviews":"55"},{"type":"ATTRACTION","image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/cf/9c/9e/cheeky-monkeys-playground.jpg","location_id":"7230516","name":"Cheeky Monkeys Playground and Amusement Center","timezone":"Africa/Cairo","location_string":"El Gouna, Hurghada, Red Sea and Sinai","photo":{"images":{"small":{"width":"250","url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/0a/cf/9c/9e/cheeky-monkeys-playground.jpg","height":"141"},"thumbnail":{"width":"50","url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0a/cf/9c/9e/cheeky-monkeys-playground.jpg","height":"50"},"original":{"width":"1328","url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0a/cf/9c/9e/cheeky-monkeys-playground.jpg","height":"747"},"large":{"width":"1024","url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/0a/cf/9c/9e/cheeky-monkeys-playground.jpg","height":"576"},"medium":{"width":"550","url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0a/cf/9c/9e/cheeky-monkeys-playground.jpg","height":"309"}},"is_blessed":false,"uploaded_date":"2016-04-05T09:05:49-0400","caption":"Cheeky Monkeys Playground and Amusement Center","id":"181378206","helpful_votes":"1","published_date":"2016-04-05T09:05:49-0400","user":{"user_id":null,"member_id":"0","type":"user"}},"api_detail_url":"https://api.tripadvisor.com/api/internal/1.14/location/7230516","awards":[],"location_subtype":"none","doubleclick_zone":"af.egypt.red_sea_and_sinai.el_gouna","preferred_map_engine":"default","raw_ranking":"2.868058681488037","ranking_geo":"Hurghada","ranking_geo_id":"297549","ranking_position":"33","ranking_denominator":"55","ranking_category":"attraction","ranking_subcategory":"#33 of 55 things to do in Hurghada","subcategory_ranking":"#33 of 55 things to do in Hurghada","ranking":"#33 of 55 things to do in Hurghada","distance":null,"distance_string":null,"bearing":null,"rating":"4.0","is_closed":false,"is_long_closed":false,"description":"","web_url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297548-d7230516-Reviews-Cheeky_Monkeys_Playground_and_Amusement_Center-El_Gouna_Hurghada_Red_Sea_and_Sina.html","write_review":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/UserReview-g297548-d7230516-Cheeky_Monkeys_Playground_and_Amusement_Center-El_Gouna_Hurghada_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html","ancestors":[{"subcategory":[{"key":"city","name":"City"}],"name":"El Gouna","abbrv":null,"location_id":"297548"},{"subcategory":[{"key":"municipality","name":"Municipality"}],"name":"Hurghada","abbrv":null,"location_id":"297549"},{"subcategory":[{"key":"region","name":"Region"}],"name":"Red Sea and Sinai","abbrv":null,"location_id":"297545"},{"subcategory":[{"key":"country","name":"Country"}],"name":"Egypt","abbrv":null,"location_id":"294200"}],"category":{"key":"attraction","name":"Attraction"},"parent_display_name":"El Gouna","is_jfy_enabled":false,"nearest_metro_station":[],"phone":"+20 106 726 0206","website":"http://www.alirides.cn","address_obj":{"street1":"Abu Tig Marina","street2":null,"city":"El Gouna","state":null,"country":"Egypt","postalcode":null},"is_candidate_for_contact_info_suppression":false,"tags":{},"reviews":[{"language":"en","title":"full of broken glass, needs someone to keep the place safe and tidy","text":"Amazing in what bad conditions this place is.

We weren't really sure where it was we were going or what the tour was of. So it was a bit of a surprise when we arrived to find that it was what seemed like a papyrus shop in a largely run down area! Once that initial feeling was out of the way, we really enjoyed the visit as we were shown how papyrus is made and the stories in the images were brought to life, the traditional calendar explained and so many anecdotal stories were told. The guide was knowledgeable and answered all of our questions. \nOur children, 9&5, were interested in the making of the papyrus and our daughter is taking her pictures that she bought into school to tell her friends all about it. As it was a free tour, and we were driven there from the hotel and back without charge, we did feel there was an expectation that we would buy something. \nAll in all it was an interesting visit and worth going, but be prepared to make a purchase of something which will serve as a lasting reminder of your holiday.

Also a good way to see how much items should be going for if you went into the centre of Hurghada, where there is so much more shops.\nOverall, a fab shopping place to get all your bits and bobs and I'll definitely be back during my holiday.

Я стояла в бюстгальтер. Я только тогда и увидела огромного паука. Чуть не умерла от страха. Стала кричать очень сильно. Потом рыдала. Продавцы обманули, сказав, что это скоробей.  Потом я поняла,  что это был паук. Теперь переживаю,  не ядовитый ли он\n\nОчень неприятно было, когда спустилась оплачивать товар, видимо старший в магазине, заругал меня за то, что я кричала.

Good sunbeds with enough space on the beach to have privacy.  Restaurant provides food/ drink.  Price to get in was 200le with a 200le food/drink minimum which is easily done if you have drinks on the beach and at least one meal.  Not sure why one reviewer thought it was for members only - we had no problem and were not \"members\".  ..we did have some push back at the gate but think it was a communication issue so we asked to speak to the manager and were welcomed.

We thought about cheaping out and doing one of the €35 tours, but I'm so glad we didn't. This one was steeper €75 but we swam with dolphins 3 times and swam in coral reefs twice, plus saw a huge whale shark which was phenomenal!! The first time was only 2 and we only caught a glimpse, second time was a pod of 8 including a baby and it was magical - we swam with them for a few minutes and they were curious about us, final time was 2 and they were curious about us too! Core memories made. The food was great, staff were so attentive. One family had 2 kids and the staff were great with them in the water. They record your entire experience on a gopro. We only speak English and it was not a problem at all, everything was spoken in German and English, booked via WhatsApp. Honestly amazing day, pay the extra. In comparison, the other ships dunk you in, you catch a glimpse and that's you done with about 100 other people.","publishedDate":"2022-10-12T08:24:51-04:00","rating":"5","travelDate":"2022-10","user":null,"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"Best crew in Egypt ","text":"I can highly recommend SimSim.

We were picked up by a very friendly gentleman and the guys on the boat was very friendly ensuring everybody is having a great time. We found two groups of dolphins - first one which was not very playful and the second one that was very playful and stayed with us for a little bit. It was absolutely brilliant to be near these beautiful creatures. The snorchling at the coral reefs was great as well,just beautiful. The food on the boat was great as well with the afternoon snacks like watermelon and donuts. I can’t remember the names of the guys on the boat but they were just all great. I cannot recommend this enough.

Nice food and drinks for whole trip (sea sickness allowing). Staff very welcoming to non-German speakers and made such an effort to look after our children's safety. Good equipment (short wetsuits worth paying 5 euro for) and an inflatable speedboat towed out to drop snorkellers off near the reef to save swimming long distances against currents. Knowledgeable team really cared for the dolphins and environment and put a big effort in to find them for us. No one was rushed until everyone was happy (some people got back in for 2-3 swims with dolphins). Snorkelling the coral reef was fantastic too.\nEarly start is well worth it to be the only boat with the dolphins.\nFANTASTIC","publishedDate":"2018-04-08T09:53:21-04:00","rating":"5","travelDate":"2018-04","user":null,"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":" Nice day trip to see dolphins","text":"Nice day trip to see dolphins in the red sea.\n\nPick up from hotel on time - good\n\nNice boat\n\nGood staff\n\nNice food, but it would be nice with more of healthy  snacks like fruits.\n\nWe saw a lot of dolphins and where very close to them - a really good experience \n\nDOWNSIDE: People are allowed to SMOKE on board !!!

Mustafa’s pedagogical training and excellent English helped to bring Luxor alive for our 7 year old. He is adept at drawing on his deep historical knowledge to explain the spirituality and traditions of the pharaohs, Egyptian religion, and other aspects of ancient Egypt. His guiding inspired even greater interest in the region and got us thinking that we are in need of a second visit to explore Egypt further. He and Moh’s team are well prepared, getting us about quickly and took us to each of the sites at what seemed to be the quietest (least busy) moments. Highly recommended.","publishedDate":"2022-10-27T06:33:17-04:00","rating":"5","travelDate":"2022-10","user":null,"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false}],"location":{"coordinates":[null,null],"address":"Hurghada Egypt"},"activities":["Tours"],"activityDesctiptor":["City Tours","Historical & Heritage Tours","Cultural Tours","Day Trips","Sightseeing Tours"],"numberOfReviews":"269"},{"type":"ATTRACTION","image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/93/5d/e2/transfer-hurghada.jpg","location_id":"10182650","name":"Transfer Hurghada","timezone":"Africa/Cairo","location_string":"Hurghada, Red Sea and Sinai","photo":{"images":{"small":{"width":"250","url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/16/93/5d/e2/transfer-hurghada.jpg","height":"150"},"thumbnail":{"width":"50","url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/16/93/5d/e2/transfer-hurghada.jpg","height":"50"},"original":{"width":"1201","url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/16/93/5d/e2/transfer-hurghada.jpg","height":"720"},"large":{"width":"1024","url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/16/93/5d/e2/transfer-hurghada.jpg","height":"614"},"medium":{"width":"550","url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/16/93/5d/e2/transfer-hurghada.jpg","height":"330"}},"is_blessed":true,"uploaded_date":"2019-02-24T10:51:00-0500","caption":"Transfer Hurghada\nFrom airport to any where \nStart prices 250 LE \nBook now ","id":"378756578","helpful_votes":"3","published_date":"2019-02-24T10:51:00-0500","user":{"user_id":null,"member_id":"0","type":"user"}},"api_detail_url":"https://api.tripadvisor.com/api/internal/1.14/location/10182650","awards":[],"location_subtype":"tour_operator","doubleclick_zone":"af.egypt.red_sea_and_sinai.hurghada","preferred_map_engine":"default","raw_ranking":"4.433478355407715","ranking_geo":"Hurghada","ranking_geo_id":"297549","ranking_position":"6","ranking_denominator":"251","ranking_category":"attraction","ranking_subcategory":"#6 of 251 Transportation in Hurghada","subcategory_ranking":"#6 of 251 Transportation in Hurghada","ranking":"#6 of 251 Transportation in Hurghada","distance":null,"distance_string":null,"bearing":null,"rating":"5.0","is_closed":false,"open_now_text":"Open Now","is_long_closed":false,"description":"Private transfer from and to Hurghada International Airport Elguna- Makadi Bay -Sahl Hasheesh- Safaga- Soma Bay -

The team have this great ability to slow everything down and still be on time for everything. Their passion for what they do  - sharing the Red Sea experience with others is infectious.  \n\nI had not dived for a few years because of Covid and Emma went through a refresher with me that was thorough and great fun  with a couple of scenic dives from the shore in relatively shallow water with loads to see - this gave me so much confidence to get on the boat I then finally (after nearly 70 dives) did my Advanced Open Water - (I had always avoided it cos I just wanted to dive not study on holiday) but Steve and Wasam made it so easy because of their great instruction.  \n\nI also watched them take some guys completely new to diving and introduce them to the wonders of life beneath the waves - they went off the boat for the first time like they had been diving for years!  - it was lovely to hear their observations after their adventures - congrats to Daniele and Bradley on your Open Water certification - I hope that this is the start of a beautiful journey for you.  \n\nIn short  - whether you are new to diving or highly experienced I would highly recommend the team at Dive UK if you want a great (and safe) diving experience in Hurghada.  \n\nCatch you again soon guys.","publishedDate":"2023-03-17T07:18:39-04:00","rating":"5","travelDate":"2023-03","user":null,"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"An unbelievable experience.","text":"After going in to scuba diving with a feeling of trepidation, I was soon put at ease. \nBoth Steve and Maged made the complex process of scuba diving easy to understand and had a calming presence. \n\nI passed my Open Water, Advanced Open Water and Rescue Diver course over our two week stay in Hurghada and in the process I witnessed the most mind blowing scenes.

A testament to the courses.\nThanks again Steve and the team we will be back!","publishedDate":"2022-10-03T00:51:16-04:00","rating":"5","travelDate":"2022-09","user":null,"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false}],"location":{"coordinates":[null,null],"address":"Makadi Hights T3-q4-s5-b3-102, Hurghada 84651 Egypt"},"activities":["Classes & Workshops","Tours","Other","Boat Tours & Water Sports","Transportation","Outdoor Activities"],"activityDesctiptor":["Scuba & Snorkeling","Sports Camps & Clinics","Adrenaline & Extreme Tours","Taxis & Shuttles","Boat Tours","Private Tours","Dolphin & Whale Watching","Day Trips"],"numberOfReviews":"168"},{"type":"ATTRACTION","image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/10/d8/d1/81/abu-simbel-tempel.jpg","location_id":"12936865","name":"Reisen in Agypten","timezone":"Africa/Cairo","location_string":"El Gouna, Hurghada, Red Sea and Sinai","photo":{"images":{"small":{"width":"150","url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/10/d8/d1/81/abu-simbel-tempel.jpg","height":"150"},"thumbnail":{"width":"50","url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/10/d8/d1/81/abu-simbel-tempel.jpg","height":"50"},"original":{"width":"640","url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/10/d8/d1/81/abu-simbel-tempel.jpg","height":"480"},"large":{"width":"550","url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/10/d8/d1/81/abu-simbel-tempel.jpg","height":"412"},"medium":{"width":"250","url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/10/d8/d1/81/abu-simbel-tempel.jpg","height":"187"}},"is_blessed":true,"uploaded_date":"2017-10-02T14:39:51-0400","caption":"Abu Simbel Tempel","id":"282644865","helpful_votes":"4","published_date":"2017-10-02T14:39:51-0400","user":{"user_id":null,"member_id":"0","type":"user"}},"api_detail_url":"https://api.tripadvisor.com/api/internal/1.14/location/12936865","awards":[],"location_subtype":"tour_operator","doubleclick_zone":"af.egypt.red_sea_and_sinai.el_gouna","preferred_map_engine":"default","raw_ranking":"4.440496444702148","ranking_geo":"Hurghada","ranking_geo_id":"297549","ranking_position":"21","ranking_denominator":"910","ranking_category":"attraction","ranking_subcategory":"#21 of 910 Tours in Hurghada","subcategory_ranking":"#21 of 910 Tours in Hurghada","ranking":"#21 of 910 Tours in Hurghada","distance":null,"distance_string":null,"bearing":null,"rating":"5.0","is_closed":false,"is_long_closed":false,"description":"Wir organisieren Ägypten Rundreisen, Luxus Nilkreuzfahrten, Tagesausflüge und Kreuzfahrtausflüge.

(We're already considering a second trip :D)","text":"I discovered the travel agency \"Reisen in Ägypten\" by chance online, and I was very positively impressed since the early planning stages: immediate responses to any enquiries, flexibility, helpfullness and reliability, which were confirmed throughout the trip.\n\nIt was the first time for me in Egypt, and, being really passionate about the ancient Egyptian civilization, culture and history, I had wanted to visit this country for a long time, so, when I finally planned to go with a friend this November, we looked for a trip that allowed us to see all of the main highlights, without having to think of any organizational or logistical aspects, and Reisen in Ägypten completely met our expectations. \n\nWe chose an 11-day trip, with the first three nights in Cairo (staying at the beautiful Sofitel on the island El Gezirah - the breakfast buffet is incredible, the spa and pool with Nile view totally worth a visit and the signature perfume in the lobby is addictive :)), visiting the archeological sites of Saqqara, Gizah and Memphis, the Egyptian Museum and the old Citadel, and taking a 1-day trip to Alexandria. \n\nWe then flew to Luxor and boarded the Nile Cruise Ship \"Blue Shadow\" (very clean rooms, friendly staff, good food - especially the oriental dinners!), where we stayed for the rest of our trip. We first visited the Valley of the Kings near Luxor, including the astounding Temple of Hatshepsut, and the Memnon Colossi, and then travelled south and stopped at the temples of Efdu and Kom Ombo, before arriving in Aswan. Here we took two facultative excursions (both highly recommended): one to the temples of Abu Simbel (including an exciting ride through the desert) and a boat trip thorough the amazing natural landscape of the Nile river to a Nubian village (swim in the Nile included :)). In Aswan, we visited Philae Temple, the High Dam and the local spices market. Now and then we also had time to relax on the sun deck of the ship (with pool ;)) and take in the breathtaking Nile views.\n\nAll our visits were conceived as private tours (with private cars and drivers - big shoutout to our amazing driver in Cairo and Alexadria, Abdallah :D), and we were either only the two of us or at most six people at a time. \n\nAnd, most importantly, we were always accompanied by our great tour guides (Abdallah in Cairo and Alexandria, and Ahmed during the whole Nile Cruise), both Egyptologists who could speak perfect German, answered all of our (many! :D) questions, were patient and helpful with our requests, and always friendly and funny. Same goes for Mr. Saladien, director of the agency, who took time to show us around in Hurghada himself, so that also our last day was not \"wasted\" only travelling.\n\nLast but not least: as women travelling alone, we did not have any unpleasant experiences, quite on the contrary, we were always treated with utmost respect, courtesy and friendliness. Neither did we have any problems with the food, but as a precaution we avoided eating unpeeled raw fruits and vegetables and we used bottled water also when brushing our teeth.\n\nIf we can give a suggestion for the future: some of the visits (for example the temple of Ramses III in Thebes West - Medinet Habu) were only available against payment of a non-insignificant extra-amount. Perhaps they could already be included in the program ;)","publishedDate":"2022-11-20T10:55:51-05:00","rating":"5","travelDate":"2022-11","user":null,"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"Great experince with wonderful organized tour","text":"Everything was perfectly organized and we had wonderful hotels and nil cruise.

Unfortunately it was a horrible trip nevertheless and i am sorry to write this, but I have to warn others... our trip was horrible, due to really bad quality of the food, missing cleanliness and generell pollution of the country. The outcome was, that we were totally sick. If you have to vomit the half of your trip (on a nilecruise) and if you have 7 days diarrhea, you cant enjoy this trip. So my recommendation for all visitors, would be that you eat only in European organized hotels / restaurants, because the risk everywhere else is just too high. Of course do not drink tabwater - but i think this should be anyway clear. But also be carefully with fruits and salats - they wash it with water from the Nile. So many passengers on our trip had to vomit or had diarrhea, so this HAS TO BE due to missing cleanness or quality of the food  / water. The doctor who treat us, called the whole sickness \"traveler diarrhea\" and told us this comes from climate change, not from pollution or food - come on, we are travelling through the whole world and had often to deal with MANY climate changes - NO WHERE we had to deal with such results. And our first hotel in Cairo (SOFITEL) was just nice, we had no sickness and no problems - because it was an European hotel with good food quality. It is also a clear sign than so many people are talking about such experiences just from Egypt - from nowhere else i heard such storys. If you ask travellers from Egypt, nearly everybody will tell you about diarrhea. So this CANT be about travelling and climate change. it is really sad, because the country with all his cultural treasures is great and the organization from \"REISEN IN ÄGYPTEN\" was really really GOOD! But for us, it has the consequence that we wont visit this country again.","publishedDate":"2022-11-10T02:54:54-05:00","rating":"4","travelDate":"2022-11","user":null,"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"Wonderful holiday","text":"For me was it a very nice cultural trip in Egypt.

Combining the rehabilitation of neglected horses and sharing the pleasures of the Eastern Desert with riders of all abilities and ages. Riding our beautiful Arabian cross horses in the spectacular scenery of the Eastern Desert is a life enhancing experience. We have horses for all levels, from complete beginners to professional riders, and everything in between! We have several child-friendly ponies so children are welcome. Normally, trips last from one to two hours, but we can arrange tailor-made full, half-day or overnight safaris to the mountains 20 kms away. We can also provide riding lessons if required. Safety is a priority with us so our equipment is of European standard including riding hats. Animal welfare is also a top priority. All our horses are well treated, well fed and happy!","web_url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297549-d2060440-Reviews-Horse_Riding_Hurghada-Hurghada_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html","write_review":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/UserReview-g297549-d2060440-Horse_Riding_Hurghada-Hurghada_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html","ancestors":[{"subcategory":[{"key":"municipality","name":"Municipality"}],"name":"Hurghada","abbrv":null,"location_id":"297549"},{"subcategory":[{"key":"region","name":"Region"}],"name":"Red
