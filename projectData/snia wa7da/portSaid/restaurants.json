Gianola was owned to a famous greek family in Port Said before it was renewed with the same name but different owner.\nI was walking with my family, so I thought let is give it a try since we have tried other Gianola dished before such as sheesh tawook and it was great.\nWe had three Meat Turkish Shawermas which are in a lebanese/turkish bread. It was like eating uncooked skin, not meat at all. It was difficult to eat since you will have to see what is really inside the sandwich! you will remove most of the uncooked skin first trying to find a way to finish it. We have eneded hours later throwing up and had diarrhea as well. \nThis was really the worst shawerma we have ever had in our life, so we will never try eating in the same restaurant again.","user":null,"title":"Worst Shawerma You will Ever Had in Your

по совету местного жителя.

Вы выбираете сами, говорите сколько и каким образом приготовить. С английским у обслуживающего персонала не очень, но они стараются изо всех сил помочь. Очень понравился какой-то вид местной крупной рыбы. Ее при подаче разделали, она получилась без костей, вкусная, сочная, вкуснее дорадо там же. Креветки тоже очень вкусные, приготовили с овощами и местными специями. 1 кг креветок, 2 рыбины, суп, лепешки, свежие овощи и лимонад на четверых обошелся около 60USD.
