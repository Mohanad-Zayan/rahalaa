It’s difficult to do chef Mahmoud justice in words when it comes to how he has mastered the Middle Eastern cuisine to this extent. As a person of Lebanese origin my expectations although I have been really impressed by the quality and taste of the food at all the restaurants at Jaz Aquamarine wasn’t so high but Sofra restaurant delivered big time!!! Such good food in a cozy restaurant that even has captured the classic restaurant music such as old covers presented by Wael Jassar that you would expect. They have really paid attention to the small  details that makes the whole visit a nice experience for me as a guest. \nIf you like Middle Eastern food and want a dinner that delivers a quality that surprises even the pickiest one among you-you should pay Sofra a visit!!!",

Main course was a seafood platter with salmon, shrimp, white fish, calamari served on a bed of couscous, zucchini and broccoli. Dessert was delicious and not too sweet. Unlimited wine, coffee, soft drinks. All for $20! Not included in resort price, but don't sleep on it. ",

The waiters have got a wicked sense of humour and so do I ,this is why I find it to be home from home. The food is excellent and so is the drink , especially the draught beer. Prices are very good considering the excellent top quality food menu that's cooked to perfection. Suburb cleanliness and Covid19 safe, strongest WiFi in Gouna!\nKeep it up Jobos and thanks for the welcome. \nAll our love \nMr Edge and Maria (Welsh not English lol)",

Chicken wings to start were like chicken nuggets with a bone stuck through the middle, tasted OK but very odd. Desserts not good but seems to be normal for Egypt unfortunately, bread very stale, again seems to be normal at the Jaz hotels. Wouldn't come again, visited as part of our once a week a la carte. Much prefer Paprika in Jaz Aquaviva for lunch which is a la carte and we can have every day (including cocktails)! Service was decent enough! ",

As we sat we were greeted by our waiter Ahmed, who was really friendly and well spoken as were the rest of the staff.\n One of the parts I really likes about the restaurant is that they're were a few cats and a stray dog that Ahmed had given a bath and was putting food and water down for them just outside of the restaurant. (I'm a big animal lover and I'd seen a few other restaurants in the marina chasing the strays away) \n\nWe had a few cocktails which were okay (could do with some little more liquor) but nice non the less and were very reasonably priced. £3 for a mohito.\n\nWhen the food arrived we were all very impressed. I had the fillet steak which was 400g and cost around £11.\nIt was cooked to absolute perfection.\n\nAfter our meal we moved to the open shisha area where we received a free shot and had another bottle of wine with some shisha which was also very good, probably the best I'd had on my trip.\n\nAll on all it was a great experience and I'd recommend anyone that goes to hurgarda to take a visit",

      "text": "On our penultimate day of our holiday in Hurgarda, we decided to visit the marina. After a lovely stroll, we choose The Greek restaurant to have our lunch. We were not disappointed, after starters of Halumi cheese & stuffed vine leaves, we both chose the chicken gyros. The food was delicious & we were given some garlic bread in between the starter & main. We finished by sharing a dessert. On paying our bill we were given shots of ice cold ouzo, which went down a treat.\nIf your lucky enough to visit the marina, pop into the Greek & enjoy great food & service.",

      "text": "We have been to Egypt multiple times and this is legit the best place to eat and get your burgers. Juicy, good buns, perfect meat to sauce ratio and plenty to choose from. But not only the burgers, the taco’s were amazing, the salads were fresh, the guacamole was unmatched and the deserts were a piece of heaven served directly in your mouth. What makes the whole experience even better is the service and the manager of the place. Our waiter was named “Islam” and in our 2 weeks holiday he was, by far, the most professional, kind, caring and loyal waiter. He served our food and drinks to perfectly match our needs. I can recommend this place 100%. Even if you are not on holiday here, you should consider coming to Egypt only to visit this amazing place.\n\n10/10 easy.",

The taste and presentation could not be faulted.\nWe had the butternut Squash and the nachos, then the Hawaiian and the burger bomb. The buns were colourful mine was orange and the husbands was green! 😊\nThe dessert we both had the cinnamon crumble pie. Again really tasteful. Could not fault it at all. \nWould recommend, as I would with all the restaurants at Jaz Aquamarine. \nThis was our 7th year here and it gets better each time we visit.",

You also get free Wi-Fi when you ask. We needed cigarettes so our waiter Ahmed sent somebody to get us the cigarettes while we were waiting for the food. The portions were big and everybody was satisfied with the “peking duck” and the other side dishes we ordered. You definitely have to try the iced coffee, it was super delicious. The Price is reasonable and definitely worth it. So far the best restaurant experience here and the service alone is worth mentioning. If you like Asian, Indian Food it’s a must try when you’re around “Marina boulevard”.",

      "text": "Amazing Sushi and staff!!\n\nVisited Red Dragon twice on our visit to Hurghada and easily the best dining experience we had the whole trip.\n\nFirst visit we had Miso soup, duck and vegetable spring rolls, and as mains 1) Shrimp noodles and 2) crispy chicken noodles. The food was excellent and we were very pleased.  This was followed by cocktails which were also great (I love Mojitos with sugar rather than only syrup!!) \n\nAlthough the first visit was hard to beat, our second visit was even better as we ordered miso soup followed by the 50 piece sushi platter. The sushi was excellent and fresh, by far the best I have had in a long time. We were very full and the sushi was packed up with a pot of soy sauce to take back to our hotel so we could finish it later! \n\nFrom the excellent food and very kind staff, I absolutely recommend Red Dragon for food or cocktails, I noticed they do shisha too. \n\nThank you again to all staff at Red Dragon for such a great experience\n\nLiam",

Then all ordered starters and mains as well as three kids meals. \n\nThe kids meals arrived quickly. But the rest of the food did not. \nThere were other people complaining for needing to wait also. Don’t encourage people into the restaurant if you can’t cater for them. We kept being assured ‘five more minutes’ but with four extremely bored children this wasn’t good enough. Eventually  after almost two and a half hours the food came, with items missing, and was average at best. \n\nOn top of this, there were no baby change facilities so had to change my little girl on the dirty toilet floor. \nPeople smoke inside of the restaurant as it’s classed as outdoors which I just don’t like at all. \n\nWouldn’t recommend.",

The restaurant staff are friendly, not pushy at all and will do all they can to make you happy. The menu is varied and all the food is of excellent quality. You've probably tried the rest so why not go for the best the next time you visit hurghada marina. 2 very happy customers from the UK, Viv and June. We will be back there before we fly home.👍",

      "text": "Despite a good location on the marina , yet they were not up to my expectations …  let me tell you why  \n1. No bread and butter or some crackers to start with as in high end restaurants ! \n2. I ordered seafood soup … small bowl very average ingredients and nothing special about it .\n3. I ordered Maritime seafood salad expecting a signature salad from the chef … It was literally Egyptian green salad ( Baladi salad) with some shrimps and calamari shreds and mussels sprinkled on its surface … very novice way to say ! \n4. main course was seafood platter .. that was very good but not outstanding .. an average piece of Salmon , one white fish fillet, 2 large shrimps and some fried rings of calamari with 2 small cups of sweet red chili sauce and tartar sauce and One side item only .. the taste was good .\n5. I had crème brûlée for dessert and was good \n6. I paid including 8% tip what is equivalent $ 50 / person \nSo my advise if you go there … don’t order soup or salad .. too expensive for a very average quality and go right to their main course and some dessert .. next time in Gouna I will go somewhere else for seafood dinner ! I was not thrilled despite high rate on TripAdvisor !",

Both are a credit to the establishment.  \n\nI would particularly recommend the mixed fajita and my girlfriend would recommend the 4 cheese pizza. \n\nWe look forward to returning to Granada on our next trip to Hurghada.  \n\nThank you all once again",

The burger combinations are well put together (we had the Mango Chicken Burger and the Halloumi Guacamole Burger) and taste great! The fries are crispy and you get a choice of 6 sauces that you can take as much as you want, at no extra charge. The drinks are also highly recommended, we had a really nice chat with the manager who was also very accommodating and friendly!\n\nFull recommendation, 5 stars!",

The paper on the plate should be taken away as you tend to eat a good bunch of it when cutting the burger which is too big to eat in the hand.\n\nA Lot of Kite people there and quite a special crowd. \n\nGot very crowded in the end and I was asked to leave my table to create more space(I was originally seated on a four person high table in the corner) and subsequently was placed at the bar with no service and also no desert delivered although orders (only git the espresso). Finally paid and left as this was physically (no space for knees) and practically (chaos and no more service) not too encouraging.",

We stayed at Steigenberger Pure Lifestyle ... a unique experience of quality, diversity and discretion. High quality services, excellent and diverse food, and its quality and staff services to the highest standards. What I really liked (among all the others ...) was the discretion of the staff that I didn't see, but that mysteriously appeared when we needed something.\nAs for Alex Beach Club & Restaurant ... I just fell in love. Top quality food, impeccable service, extremely pleasant and attentive staff .... I have no words ..... the special evening was magical ...... For the services and attention of the staff I have only words of praise , but I liked the services offered by Roshdy Mohab the most .... the nicest and most attentive bartender. Every day at the beach was magical with Roshdy Mohab, who from day one taught us her name, who smiled and talked to us .... extremely nice and polite and who did it in such a way that we didn't miss it. nothing and feel like the most spoiled people on the beach. The manager - Alex Beach Club & Restaurant - should take great care of \"Our Roshdy\" :)), because I will return to Steigenberger Pure Lifestyle for everything he has given me ... but mostly for Roshdy Mohab .

So tender and tasty! \n\nWe enjoyed them so much we went back for a Sunday roast which was also delicious. My husband had the lamb which was perfect, it just fell off the bone. \n\nCan tell the owner is passionate about the restaurant, and serving quality food.\n\nWe'll be back next time we're in El Gouna.\n",

Easy 10 …..",

Sunday roast was delicious just like you would cook at home and the camel steaks and burgers are second to none the steak is the best meat I have ever tried. Everything about this place is first class, the people the service and 100% the food",

      "text": "We have been visiting this restaurant ever since Maged and his team have owned it.  We visit mostly as a couple but have had several nights where we have been in groups of up to 18 guests.\n\nWe have never been disappointed at all. Service is excellent with great attention to detail.   The food is second to none and great value for money given the portion sizes.  There is a great choice of food to cater for all tastes. Last night we had garlic mushrooms and prawn cocktail to start.  Amazing.  Followed up by quality beef and Yorkshire puddings with great tasting gravy and proper creamed horseradish.   My partner said his T-Bone was then best steak he had eaten in years.  All this washed down with very cold drinks and then banana cheesecake and chocolate fondant with ice cream - a true must for any chocolate lovers!!\n\nI would give Puddleduck's 10 out of 5 if I could.  Highly recommended and will remain as a firm favourite of ours in El Gouna. \n\nPay them a visit - you won't be disappointed.",

Food is really good and the portions are big.\nMost importantly, the hospitality of this place is outstanding. We really love how Mahmoud and his team make you feel welcome. The hospitality and interest in their guests is sincere and you can feel, see, and taste the passion for their job.\nSpecial thanks to Mahmoud who made our visits so far extra enjoyable. See you tomorrow!\n\nAngela & Kitty",

We ordered Butter Shrimp, naan, mixed Grill and Seafood soup, water and Diet Coke. Butter Shrimp had no Indian spice at all rather some sauce from the bottle. Naan was crisps tortillas I asked for Egyptian bread. He brought stele bread. Mixed grill was cold or maybe left over from lunch. After discount we paid 900ESP plus tip.\nAfter disappointing dinner we both got sick at night. I would not recommend this restaurant.",

We were surprised to have our expectations shattered by actually great food with a unique savory taste. Our host, Fatma, was a shining star on top. She was very friendly and a cheery face that greeted us, talked us through the menu and shared her own opinions and other opinions as well on each dish and what would better suit our tastes! Her advice was well-given as the plates we have selected from her top choices were marvelous (except my own plate which I stubbornly selected from her bottom recommendations... should have known better). I think the restaurant was under-staffed as Fatma was doing all jobs around us from serving us drinks, to teaching my retro parents how to hold chopsticks as well as serving other tables and running between the different Asian restaurants on site to get refreshments. The hard work atmosphere did not dampen her spirits and she worked hard to make sure we were more than just satisfied with our meal. 10/10 would come again.",

The Tom Sum - green papaya salad is also excellent. We eat a lot of Thai food back home on Virginia, USA, and spent 2 weeks in Thailand in 2020, se feel that we can give a good review.",

There were 14 of us In total. We walked in and asked for a table. Within seconds it felt they had made up a table ready for us. And the food was to die for. I have eaten at a lot of places and this restaurant is top of my list. The presentation was amazing and the price very good considering how great the staff were and the quality of food on offer. The second visit the place was packed so was told go away for 10 minutes while they made up a table. True to their word 9 minutes later after a bit of shopping we went back to a perfectly dressed table waiting for us. We thought due to how busy it was we would have a worse service. No food took similar times to come out and all together so we could eat as a group. My only regret is I didn’t get a chance to eat out more here and try out more of the menu. I was very happy with my experience and would highly recommend anyone who may visit to eat here as they won’t be let down. Thankyou for such a great service and brilliant food",

You arent rushed and they are genuinely interested in you enjoying the food and experience. \n\nWe had soup for starters, shrimps for appetisers,  I had stuffed chicken and husband had the steak and that was delicious - it melted in the mouth  and we both had cheesecake for dessert and I didn't want the cheesecake to finish. \n\nIve attached some pics but they DO NOT do the food any justice what so ever \n\nIf and when you come to Hurgarda book into the Aqua restaurant i guarantee you will NOT be disappointed \n\nIts 1st Class !!!! \n\nThank you to all the team in the restaurant 🙏🙏🙏",

      "text": "Fabulous evening out at Aqua restaurant, part of the Jaz hotel chain. We have eaten out at some of the other restaurants in the chain and whilst the food was nice the service has not lived up to 5 star. Our waiter was Deif was brilliant, he really understood what good service meant, knowing when to be attentive and when to step away. We loved his pink panther cocktails too! The food was excellent, we had the beef fillet and also the surf and turf. In between courses we was treated to giant prawns and also a visit from the chef who was very polite and friendly. We are already looking forward to coming back to Aqua tomorrow for lunch, to enjoy the great food and beach views.",

Light, tasty and incredibly moreish! Every step during our 3 course meal was delivered by the waiting staff in a professional and engaging manner . Well done to all, we had a lovely evening and the menus with lights are a great idea !!",

The staff were fabulous, attentive enough without being overbearing.\n\nThe food was amazing and reasonably priced. We had soup to start and both had the surf and turf for the main, fillet steak and king prawns that were cooked to perfection. 3 cocktails each  (they do a mean bloody Mary) and bottle of wine, and the total cost was £60 for 2 people, which I think is very reasonable given the quality of fare.\nWe had a complimentary drink following our meal which was a lovely touch, and rounded off a pretty perfect evening.",

We went inside and waited for an empty table, once people at one table finished we went there but some of the staff said that we should inform them and stay at the line because this table for other people. Then they gave tables for all peoples which came after us but inform the staff that they need a table. If you make a system with informing the staff about your coming then you should ask about it all guests by yourself. Once we reach all waiting line we get a dirty table with all rubbish from previous visitors and instead of cleaning our table staff clean all tables around till my husband ask to clean table for us. Then manager personally ask what we want to eat without giving us a menu before. All waiters and other staff as cleaner a table did them job fast and good as it was possible during this situation. For them I can just say thank you. If managers can’t manage the place then maybe they need more attention from the owner because for last 2 years service really went down. Food as usual good but soup more watery than it was before so didn’t like to order it here any more.",

      "text": "We visited last night, wow... the bill came to 550 E.L!!! And the food portion and quality were out of this world.\n\nWe had massively over ordered and the waiter was very honest, which we really respected as we asked for over a kilo of prawns lobster and calamari ... along with the mixed seafood pasta, ( we had it in white source lots of prawns And calamari very tasty and about 100 E.L). Mixed fish soup, prawns cocktail, and then all our fresh fish\n\nSo the man being very honest said get 300g of two, it's a lot of food. We valued this as there have been places where we felt money was the value of the transaction!. Which you have to understand while in Hurghada, they egyptian people work EXTREMELY HARD! So tip your hotel staff, ( who work 7.30am-6pm, 7 DAYS A WEEK FOR A MONTH! And then can go home and see the family for a week. The waiting staff and hospitality staff also work long times and shifts. We ended up leaving 120  E.L after our meal as it was great.\n\nSo what we actually ended up ordering: \n\nPrawns cocktail- ridiculous price about 40. E.L!\nMixed seafood soup- big variety of fish.\nThe mixed seafood pasta- very generous portion.\nFresh Calamari- 250g - very good calamari.\nThe fresh prawns- 500g- huge and juicy king prawns!\nThey brought out two plates of dip and a huge basket of fresh bread, which were still hot that level of fresh! \nOh and 1× water and 2×coke.\n\nWe over ordered but had a good go and so impressed! \n\nThe comments we have seen on here that have some negatives, a few seem to be about decoration. Its not a five star restaurant inside, don't get me wrong, me and my finance love eating out, from Michelin to small and local, and will try anything. But if your fussy enough to be bothered it's basic, for the price, and it being local... your being picky. It also does not serve alcohol, but the service is quick... so have the best seafood near the marina, and go for lovely drinks on the actual marina.\n\n Which brings me to the most important point, location ... ITS NOT ON THE MARINA ITS BEHIND IT! Don't do what we did and walk it twice looking in every alley haha ! Walk to the end of the marina so you can enjoy the views, have a drink, eye up a shisha for after. When you get past waves to the end, ask the man with his camel or little candy shops for the restaurants they will guide you out. \n\nFrom the bottom end of the marina,( near waves ), you can also walk through the bizarre  before it and get out that entrance. There are some taxi and a round about. Turn right round the round about up past the fresh fish. About four shops up you arrive. Enjoy. \n\nIf fish and quality is your thing, make sure you visit!",

It’s a funky space with benched booths and serves decent drinks and some nice appetisers/tapas we went for chicken wings, meatballs, calamari, bruschetta and onion rings rather than main course meals and were incredibly tasty. Staff are pleasant friendly and attentive whilst not being over familiar or pushy and I would highly recommend it for a visit \nHammed, thanks for the discount on our last night.",

Ahmed served us and could not do enough for us… highly recommend this restaurant, not only for its quirky mushrooms and decor but especially the food and service… thank you",

It was the right choice - the food was simply excellent, all freshly cooked, quality ingredients -quite simply the best meal we had in the whole entire 10 days.  The service was excellent, informative and friendly, advising on all our questions - just a shame we only found it on our last night 😉. Very highly recommended…",

They will accommodate any special dietary requirements if you ask \n\nStaff are very attentive and the owners are welcoming including Sultan the resident Labrador \n\nReally is a great night out and worth the visit.

The food was served hot and we didn’t need to ask for any extras as it was all provided when served. Portions sizes are very good and the deserts were lovely. \n\nStaff: all the staff were extremely tentative especially Akhmed, ask for him when you visit as he will take care of you and will make sure you have the best experience so much so you will return again and again like we did. \n\nAtmosphere: was relaxed, chilled, clean….We’re looking forward to visiting the Moods team very soon.\n\nPrices: not expensive.",

As a solo, older European woman this was a perfect place to spend an afternoon. Now back to the food! Very fresh, cooked to order, delicious pastas, pizzas, salads and seafood. Have nice mocktails, shakes and fresh juices if you don't do alcohol. Unhurried, friendly but not overbearing service. 100% recommended. ",

We passed this place 2 days ago, and it was the only restaurant where a waiter came and spoke to us, so we went back tonight, and we'll, all I can say is gorgeous.\nBreak & dips starter and Las Vegas wings to start, which were tasty & juicy.\n For mains, I had a Rocky Mountain Burger that was one of the best burgers I've ever had. Cooked to perfection and juicy. My OH had the mixed skewer, which again was perfectly cooked and absolutely divine. The chef certainly knows how to use his BBQ grill, better than most places in the UK. Don't walk past, go inside, and enjoy one of the tastiest meals in Hurgharda. ",

Food fresh, very authentic American burger. Service excellent (thank you Ahmed, my waiter). Prices comparable to other Hurghada Marina restaurants however value is superior. A bonus is the comfortable seating, directly facing the Marina. Clean. A definite 5 star!",

Food was very well cooked and came quickly and tasted fantastic. Me and my partner had the ribeye steak which was cooked to perfection. The kids had a pizza each and potato wedges to share but couldn't eat it all, so the restaurant very kindly packaged it up so that we could take it away with us. If you're looking for a change of scenery from eating at your hotel, we would definitely recommend Sardinia restaurant.\nThank you for looking after us, 5* service and we will be returning before the end of our holiday to try the T Bone 😀",

It did not disappoint one bit.\n\nFirst things first,,, you must reserve here (especially if on a weekend night).  They are often packed.  \n\nThe first impression is of a charming atmosphere - with nice lighting and good music.  The service was friendly and professional from start to finish of our experience.  The waiters gave us good suggestions when we had questions about the menu.\n\nAnd the Food !!!  All was delicious.  The Tiradito starter with a layer of white fish and a lightly cooked shrimp in an incredible sauce.  The white fish was so tasty and fresh that I decided to order the white fish taco as my main.  The shrimp risotto - that we shared - was excellent as well.  Not too much parmesan and the risotto was cooked just right.\n\nAlthough its a simple place, I would definitely rate this the best restaurant in Gouna and top ten in all of Egypt.  Just don't forget to call ahead to reserve your table.",
