I must say the food was absolutely lovely it was hot when it arrived at our table however we arrived and gave our order within 10 minuets of arriving and we waited and waited and waited. There was no other customers waiting for food or drinks there was no explanation as to why we were waiting however we caught the eye of the waiter and he went to find out. We were waiting due to the equipment breaking down but no one told us. We waited nearly one hour and although any machine can break down it was poor service not to tell you why you are waiting so long. I realise I am in Egypt but the waiter spoke acceptable English. That was the only complaint they need to get their act together before more customers come. It looks like they are also having some new furniture there. In the near future they will serve a take away service. The surroundings are warm and relaxing and the staff are smiling and friendly. Yes I will go back with friends but I hope they take on board that they need good communication between customers and all staff. Good luck to you in the future.","user":null,"title":"Jive Bar Nabq","owner_response":null,"subratings":[],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false},{"id":"575869282","lang":"en","location_id":"5420441","published_date":"2018-04-26T08:36:14-04:00","published_platform":"Desktop","rating":"5","type":"review","helpful_votes":"0","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297555-d5420441-r575869282-Jive_1_Bar-Sharm_El_Sheikh_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review575869282","travel_date":"2018-04","text":"Jive1 is fabulous relaxing and if your a footie fan this is the place to be.

We ordered Egyptian food, want to say, that it was really tasty and the presentation of the main dish was amazing, thank you a lot.

To our delight, him and Ali brought the chef over to discuss in detail. As the restaurant was closing and my friend and I were the last ones there, Motawea sat with us and wrote down all the ingredients/recipe for me so that I could make the Mezze on my own. \n\nIt’s rare to leave a dinner feeling equally full as well as entertained so we’re very appreciative for Motawea, Ali and the rest of the staff for such an enjoyable dinner our first night in Egypt!

The higher entry price is worth It. The music is chill. The lounge chairs are set up in a very good manner, with a certain amount space and shade. The clientele was attractive, more international, and respectful. The vibe was great. \n\nThe coral reef is excellent to snorkel, just in front of the resort. There is a small jetty to use for an entry point. \n\nThe staff was friendly and they offer waiter service at your little sunning spot. The drinks and food are on the more expensive side.

have to start by saying, I can't understand why the grill house has not even made it to the top 10. I'm shocked, as I have been there 4 times with my children, and every single time the food was amazing. Freshly cooked food, lovely outdoor space on the roof, staff are all very polite, I gave a tip to one waiter whose name I just cannot remember but I hope he sees this review as not only was he happy, smiling, and cheerful each time I saw him, he was patient. He deserves a huge tip for his service to me and my family. I ordered the BBT more than twice, it's a double chicken burger, and I had chips, onion rings, and nuggets. All the food here was cooked perfect, it was amazing and I highly recommend the grill to anyone coming to sharm el sheikh. Once you have been here, your keep coming back. And you won't be disappointed. You should be in the top 10. Thank you so much for the great service and amazing food.

Seen some reviews about the wait for food,  we went 3 times in the 2 weeks we stayed and never experienced any long wait.  The portions are really good,  had the sharing platter,  which I'm guessing is a started,  we were stuffed after it and I had a steak as I didn't expect to be full after my starter 😂.  Prices are not too bad either.  To say me and my wife were full after the starter that cost around £9 I'm not complaining at all.  Cheaper than mcdonalds over the road.  I have read that there is no beer,  I asked for one and did wait a while for it to arrive,  I'm going to guess someone went to the shop down the road for one 🤔,  either way I got a Stella and it was cold.

It's convenient because I live close by. It's hit or miss never consistent which is frustrating because you never know what to expect. Today was a bad experience. I usually try to keep it as simple as possible however I ordered fish with a lemon butter sauce how could it possibly go wrong. The fish and veg finally arrived after God knows how long and of course without the sauce. And of course no waiter in sight for ages, then when I finally get the waiter Saeed he then gives me a cry me a river story that never seemed to end about why there was no sauce. By this time the food is cold. I've waited table's and worked in plenty of service oriented jobs, and learnt to just be honest and admitt that you messed up. This is much appreciated and acceptable.

To be honest I didn’t expect such a wonderful dining experience. To start from the beginning: nice quiet atmosphere (not banging music like in many cafes here), the staff keep distance and do not try to be over friendly with the customers. The drinks are served very quickly (mango juice and fresh lemon with mint must be tried). The food menu offers you big variety of starters, main courses and lots of sandwiches (even if you are not hungry you will definitely eat something). Special thanks to Chef (even I didn’t see him) but the pasta bolognese...mmmm.. to die for. The burger (soooooo big) and served with lots of fries and veggies. To sum up - I was not able to finish my meal as the portions are too big. It should be noted that the prices are very reasonable. Furthermore the shisha they serve not like everywhere in Sharm, they offer special coil (cocoa coil) that makes the process of smoking is enjoyable. I will definitely recommend this outlet.

love to discover different cafes and restaurants everywhere I go. This time I’ve visited Alhambra at Nabq. Very cosy and nice cafe. I personally don’t like crowds and people yelling around so it was perfect for me and my friends. There are enough tables outside, so you can enjoy your food or drinks breathing fresh air. The food is good, tasty and filling. The portions are quite big as for me. I ordered tuna salad and grilled shrimps with veggies. Tuna salad was more than enough for me :) . I loooove their lemonade or lemon fresh . Really good. \nThe staff is hospitable and polite. I also liked the fact that they play various music and not only Arabic or Russian hits.

This restaurant was advised to us by our hotel as the best seafood in Sharm. From the moment we stepped into this restaurant, to the moment we left it, it was stressful and disappointing and borderline angering. \nAfter having ordered from the fresh fish section (make sure you ask the price of what you are ordering: I have ordered lobster for 45$ per kg, which seemed a quite high price  and insisted that they weight it in front of me), hardly had we managed to sit down and not even yet opened the menu, when the pushy waiters started to put pressure on us by suggesting things to order. after mentioning several times that we'd like to see the menu first, we eventually gave in since they were becoming unhappy, rude and extremely pushy. This resulted in a bill way higher than what we were expecting, which wouldn't have happened had we left in peace to make our order. \nAs for the food, I had ordered lobster which was dry, overcooked, and the best part (the claws) cut out and according to the waiters, thrown away. The fresh grilled fish tasted like defrosted and also dry and not even properly salted. \n\nOur visit to this restaurant was waste of our time, money and resulted in a spoilt mood.

and my friend came here late one evening-she had just arrived and her flight was delayed, so we missed the evening meal at our hotel. We were looking for something close by and easy food, so this fit the bill.\nIt was coming up to midnight and even though they looked like they were finishing soon/kitchen closed, they were happy to accommodate us with a limited menu. \nI'd heard of the Bus Stop before visiting Nabq, so was aware of The Bus Stop Burger, but unfortunately this was not available as the main chef had gone home. I settled on a SeaFood Pasta-my friend the same. We also got a bottle of white wine with the meal.\nThe owner chatted to us for a few minutes-quite normal-but then one of the staff members pulled up a chair for him and he literally sat there for the whole meal until we left.\nBear in mind, my friend had just arrived, so we were chatting away between mouthfuls of food and enjoying the wine. Yet the owner continued to sit there.....initially just small talk-where you from/staying/for how long-then very quickly moving onto how he knows/owns this and that, can get us into xyz for free, can book this trip, that trip. Yes, I  half listened as some of it might had been useful, but it became me and my friend chatting, him saying we talk too quickly-we were talking to each other-with him trying to 'sell/give us contacts' whenever we weren't talking/were eating. Yes, he might had been genuine, but I've been to Egypt often enough, to know that 99.9% of time they are always on the sell/want something. Also, I don't want to be tied to some guy for our holiday-no Thank You.\nAnyway, the food was actually nice and the wine was lovely. The venue is pretty cool aswell. It's a modern sports bar. I would had returned for the Women's England opener, but as I wanted an unmithering evening, I went to The Union Jack..........","user":null,"title":"Excellent-if the manager didn't sit with us all

Honestly 2 weeks in Egypt 🇪🇬  all inclusive our hotel food was terrible and we ate McDonald's nearly every night. One evening we stumbled across Melodies and the staff and food was amazing we had such a great meal and the staff was so warm and welcoming. Before we left we said can we book a table for 2 nights time as it our sons 18th. Mohammed promised us he will save our table and even get banners, balloons and a birthday cake for our return. Je took a risk as we didn't pay a deposit yet like him we stuck to our word and so did he and upon arrival he gave us a birthday corner. His staff sung happy birthday in 4 different languages and again the food was amazing. I wished we found this place on day one as the prices was very fair and honestly could have charged more as the quality was fab.

Without me noticing, he grabbed my wife's ass (very firmly with all his hand and strength). She was in shock and said nothing at the beginning... Then he did it again while asking another coworker of him to take a picture. We left after that, and my wife told me what happened. I went back to confront him, and this coward piece of *** denied everything. I told him to tell the truth and be a man, but he started saying that his \"hand touched there by mistake\" and all kind of bull***. This guy is a women molester, a coward and a liar.

friend and I experienced a very unpleasant situation at Farsha Mountain Lounge. We tried to get in the place but were treated rudely by the staff. At reception, we were told that only couples were accepted. We said we are just friends and wanted to see the place and enjoy the sunset. I also showed a message I received from Farsha saying adults only, couples and mixed groups were accepted. Then the manager very rudely said he would make an exception and let us in. But he placed us at a table far away and hidden, with no view. We understood that we were not welcome and decided to leave the place. It was a very humiliating situation that I had never been through in my life.

Our prices are competitive to the prices of similar places in Sharm. We are not willing to put the quality of our food  at risk to be able to lower our prices. \nIn addition to this, imported items have incurred in higher custom fees which, along with the devaluation of the Egyptian Pound, obviously have a direct impact on our costs.\nWe always aim to the best quality standards and in order to provide the quality service which we aim to and which makes us different from many similar businesses in Sharm. We have conducted price comparisons with other operating bars in the area and strived to maintain reasonable pricing without compromising on the quality of service and hygiene maintenance in all our outlets.\nWe do provide promotions for our guests to enjoy discounted drinks during Happy Hour every day 6 -730 pm.\nWe have recently organized live music during various events and we always like to keep guests informed about our events on social media.

We came at 3:40pm and there was no DJ and to our horror no food. Restaurant is closed between 3:30pm and 7pm. So enjoy your salad with tuna from a can - the only option at that time. Dj as we were told was to restart at 16:00 but that did not happen. \n3)Worst cocktail - they made pina colada using canned pineapple and it tasted like third degree drink not worth the money with no flavor or taste. \n4)Topless beach.

We can see only assume each of the four restaurants has its own kitchen as the food feels, looks and tastes authentic. \n\nFirst night in Egypt so we opted for Luxor’s native fare. Appetisers of calves liver and peppers, tahini and salad were spot on. Mains of lamb fattah and chicken shish tawook similarly so. Fattah is spiced boiled lamb/beef served over a bed of rice and toasted pita bread with a delicious garlicky warm tomato sauce. A feast in your mouth.\n\nNot diluted for tourist tastes they offer authentic local cuisine such as soup or a main dish made with cows feet. I’m a fan of pigs trotters when cooked well so I’m going for the bovine version on my next trip. \n\nEgyptian wine is surprisingly good with red being a bit more like a reasonable French plonk than you’d think.

The Indian restaurant was full but Luxor - Egyptian was available. We had to wait 20 minutes to be served and that’s after asking. We ordered a simple mixed grill and 2 drinks. Our food arrived after 25 minutes and drinks just before. The chicken was undercooked and at first we thought it was just the way they present or cook their meat. I only took a small bite and it was disgusting. It was too rubbery so we left the food and got charged £35. The next day I had food poisoning and called the doctor. I was in excruciating pain for hours and had to keep going to the bathroom. Next early morning I was on a drip and tablets in my hotel room. We hadn’t eaten anywhere else as that was our first meal in Egypt. I was put off chicken the whole holiday and was on medication for 4 days. Really poor service, besides the chicken, the other food was awful too. The portions are small, tasteless, expensive and you are not served any bread or dips with your meal. The customer service was atrocious. We wanted to try the Indian there but the same people own the 4 restaurants so we didn’t go there.

Still we live Thai food so we headed there on the first night of our trip.\n\nSadly my wife's soup was very lacking in flavour - tasted watered down - and my chicken satay were dry with the peanut sauce not even tasting of nuts.  The mains were ok, but still very bland and not at all spicy.  Maybe they were made plain for tourists, but it was not what we are used to.\n\nGood service and decent prices but only Egyptian wine available for a sensible price and that takes a bit of getting used to.

As a brit that has not had fish and chips in 5 years I was soooo surprised with this place. The fish was fresh and the batter light and crispy. The portion was huge too. I expected it to be pub grub but it was much better. Also linda the chef/owner was extremely friendly and flexible to our requests.

A great start to the meal. \n\nThis time Tess was not that hungry so just one main - succulent herby and delicately spiced grilled chicken. Last time an excellent beef stifado for Tess and tender, delightful roast octopus for me. \n\nJust about room left to share a desert - Kataïfi is a traditional pastry made with a nut filling and soaked in a sugar or honey. This is THE best we’ve ever had. You can tell there are Greek chefs in the kitchen. \n\nAdded to all the above - beautiful live guitar and bouzouki music. Not tacky tourist stuff, but evocative and expressive by a skilled musician. I’m a live music promoter back home and I really rate this guy. The real treat for us was room to dance, of which we took plenty of advantage.","user":null,"title":"Superb Greek food, lovely staff and

range of excellent cuts from local rib eye to top of the shop wagu. \n\nComfortable elegant setting more akin to New York than Sharm el Sheikh. But somehow it works. Low level lighting, wood panelling and a fell of old world luxury. \n\nThe food and service are both excellent. The meats cooked bang on to order. I went for Egyptian rib eye as I couldn’t personally see how meat flown in from Australia could be much better. If the chef knows what he or she is doing then it should be good. And it is. Absolutely perfectly seasoned, juicy, charred on the outside and delicious. Everything you want from a good steak. Top notch chips and veg with a deep and spicy pepper sauce on the side. I had creamed spinach as a side dish - so good I ordered another half way through my meal as I’d polished the first one off. \n\nTess wasn’t that hungry so she had two appetisers. Kicking off with their “classic wedge” salad - crunchy fresh salad with onion straws, beef bacon and to-die-for blue cheese crumble - an Egyptian blue that is identical to Roquefort. All dressed perfectly with French dressing. \n\nNext up - mini rib-eye. Juicy slices of steak with chimmichuri, garlic yogurt, sliced red onion and crunchy coated onion rings. Wonderful according to Tess. \n\nAttentive but not intrusive service from a lovely waitress and the restaurant manager. \n\nOne to make sure you visit.","user":null,"title":"Steaks are high… standard!","owner_response":null,"subratings":[],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false},{"id":"882675142","lang":"en","location_id":"1827386","published_date":"2023-03-18T15:41:41-04:00","published_platform":"Desktop","rating":"5","type":"review","helpful_votes":"0","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297555-d1827386-r882675142-L_entrecote_Steak_House-Sharm_El_Sheikh_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review882675142","travel_date":"2023-02","text":"Juicy steaks, nice atmosphere, polite staff, loved the crumpled potatoes, the meat is delicious, nice place. \n","user":null,"title":"Egypt, SoHo 2023","owner_response":{"id":"882794332","lang":"en","published_date":"2023-03-19T13:03:55-04:00","connection":"General Manager","responder":"SOHO Management","text":"Dear Customer,\n\nThank you for taking the time to write the above review of your dining experience at l'Entrecote Soho Square.\n\nWe are happy you enjoyed your time and look forward to seeing you again.\n\nBest Regards,","title":"Owner Response"},"subratings":[{"name":"Service","value":"5"},{"name":"Value","value":"5"},{"name":"Food","value":"5"}],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false,"photos":[{"id":"679173690","locations":[{"name":"L'entrecote Steak House","id":"1827386","web_url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297555-d1827386-Reviews-L_entrecote_Steak_House-Sharm_El_Sheikh_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html","intent_url":"tripadvisor:///Restaurant_Review-g297555-d1827386-Reviews-L_entrecote_Steak_House-Sharm_El_Sheikh_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html","parent_location_id":297555}],"published_date":"2023-03-18T19:38:09-0400","user":{"username":"alexsV2654DS","member_id":"0","user_id":"ED0E866A541AD940594954E7E2729A1E","type":"user","avatar":{"id":"452388042","caption":"default-avatar-2020-51","published_date":"2020-02-21T15:55:30-0500","helpful_votes":"0","is_blessed":false,"uploaded_date":"2020-02-21T15:55:30-0500","images":{"small":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e4/ca/default-avatar-2020-51.jpg","width":"150","height":"150"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/ca/default-avatar-2020-51.jpg","width":"50","height":"50"},"original":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e4/ca/default-avatar-2020-51.jpg","width":"1200","height":"1200"},"large":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1a/f6/e4/ca/default-avatar-2020-51.jpg","width":"450","height":"450"},"medium":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1a/f6/e4/ca/default-avatar-2020-51.jpg","width":"205","height":"205"}}}},"helpful_votes":"0","is_blessed":false,"uploaded_date":"2023-03-18T19:38:09-0400","images":{"small":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/28/7b/5e/3a/caption.jpg","width":"150","height":"150"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/28/7b/5e/3a/caption.jpg","width":"50","height":"50"},"original":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/28/7b/5e/3a/caption.jpg","width":"3000","height":"4000"},"large":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/28/7b/5e/3a/caption.jpg","width":"338","height":"450"},"medium":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/28/7b/5e/3a/caption.jpg","width":"154","height":"205"}}}]},{"id":"882419430","lang":"en","location_id":"1827386","published_date":"2023-03-16T11:11:00-04:00","published_platform":"Mobile","rating":"5","type":"review","helpful_votes":"0","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297555-d1827386-r882419430-L_entrecote_Steak_House-Sharm_El_Sheikh_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review882419430","travel_date":"2023-03","text":"Just come here for a meal.

Your average family of 5 meal with drinks will not break the bank and you'll leave with a full tum, memories you'll never forget and the most important part, you'll leave as a friend ☺❤️\nAs for the review about the dogs, these dogs are cherished and cared for kindly and respectfully by the locals and the owner and are not a problem, if anything they are the highlight of the night as they look for little belly rubs and love 😍\n\nThe atmosphere is very much chill and easy, kick your shoes off and enjoy the shisha by Mohamed who sees it as an art... Then you'll be served with a smile and laugh by all the amazing waiters!!!\n\nFood varies from pizza, pasta, chicken, steaks, sandwiches, salads, seafood and much more... Dishes average at £5 and drinks are amazing 💖 so much choice!!!!\nAbsolute gem of a place...
