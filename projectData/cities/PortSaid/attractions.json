The light and sound shows at the Giza Pyramids with dinner after and the Philea Temple in Aswan were both great choices not to be missed (make sure to request your choice of language).  Everything was perfectly arranged from the moment of our first contact, with much kindness and professionalism by Tayso, he was always available and prompt to respond and we are very grateful for his service!

We would like to mention our amazing guide we had on our trip to Cairo, Giza etc., Abdurehman and our wonderful driver in Cairo, Mohammad. We felt very comfortable and safe with these guys. They were very considerate, courteous and friendly. Abdurehman has vast knowledge about the ancient Egypt. We learned a lot about the ancient Egyptian history from him.

It has struggled with some safety concerns over the years, but our 9 days in Egypt, WE FELT SAFE. In fact, we felt WELCOMED. We felt LOVED. We were treated not like tourist, but more FAMILY! \n\nOur highly skilled driver, MINA - drove us around Giza, Cairo and Alexandria safely. We are imptrsswd that he was able to breeze throught the tight streets with ease. He would even share a few interesting sites along the way! And after a full day, we slept like babies on the way back to the hotel. He ensured that when we alight- we cross the roads safely and not in harms way.\n \nTHE BEST Tour Guide - TONSI! - Very knowledgeable and funny guy! He shared a lot of history and infused it with simple words so we didnt feel bored and find it actually interesting! He has a good command in English so it wasnt difficult for us. He offered us good deals and let us decide - NO PUSH! HO HASSLE! as they always say 😀… He was alao very honest in giving feedback on tours and activities so we didnt waste time in visiting places that are not worth to see. \n\nSo yes, Egypt will always be in our hearts- not just the places but the people as well. We are reminded that we have a family in Egypt in the short span of 9 days. \n\n The one who assisted out bookings - AZOMA was very responsive as well. We book transfers with another agency and suddenly wanted to change price the last minute. Asoma gladly accommodated our request and made aure the driver was there on time! \n\nEMO tours is the #1 tour operator in Egypt. They have packages not only in Cairo but all-over the country. Since some places require tours for your visit- book it with EMO! \n\nI will be happy to share their contact details upon request This is not a paid post- I am just sharing the good experience we had with EMO..","publishedDate":"2023-02-02T00:06:13-05:00","rating":"5","travelDate":"2023-01","user":null,"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"Excellent Guided Tours in Egypt","text":"Excellent support from Emo Tours team.

The cost of the tour per person was reasonable-priced. The tour guide was Mohamed Mostafa and the driver was Safwat.  On the first day, we were picked up promptly at 8am at Port Said, where our cruiseship was docked.  During our 3-hour drive to Cairo, Mohamed provided very limited commentary. He did provide options for camel rides ($15 per person or $25 for two people for a 10 minute camel ride to view three Pyramids; $75 for a 45 minute camel ride around all nine Pyramids) and a Nile River dinner cruise ($50 per person at Nile Maxim) in the evening.  We were presssured to make our decision in only 10 minutes, as he indicated that the tours would sell out. After a quick group consultation, we decided to do the camel rides and Nile River dinner cruise. Our first day was quite hectic, as we first toured the Egyptian Museum (only 45 minutes, guided by Mohamed) and then onto the Giza Pyramids.  He recommended against touring the inside of the Great Pyramid.  We decided to go anyways by ourselves, which turned out to be the highlight for my elderly father.  There's a long stretch of narrow and at times low step and not much to see inside but it was interesting to tour the inside nonetheless.  There were a lot of camels outside of the Pyramids eagerly waiting for customers.  We found out later from one of the cruise passengers that they only paid $7 for the 10 minute ride.  We were quite upset that Mohamed overcharged us. We were then taken to the Sakkara Step Pyramids and arrived at 3:30pm.  By then, we still hadn't had lunch.  We were originally supposed to have lunch at a restaurant but due to limited time (the attractions close at 4pm), we agreed to eat local sandwiches that Mohamed would get for us at the end of our tour for the day.  After the Sakkara Step Pyramids, we  went to an overpriced shop that Mohamed recommended.  By then, we were not only tired but very hungry.  When we finished and boarded the bus, we were given our sandwiches to eat on our way to the Mena House Oberoi Hotel in Cairo.  It was a beautiful, spacious and modern hotel with a view of the Great Pyramid in the background.  We had to practically beg Mohamed to give us some time to freshen up for 30 minutes at the hotel before our ride to the Giza for our 2-hour dinner cruise.  He took us a to a souvenir shop beforehand.  By 7:30pm, we had arrived at the small riverboat for dinner.  The food was average (appetizer buffet of different types of salads, chicken or fish entree and a dessert.  Drinks were an extra cost).  The interior was tastefully decorated,  There was a small stage with live singers and a belly dance performance.  Guests could also go outside to enjoy the views.   Mohamed and the driver then picked us up promptly afterwards.   We later found out that the dinner cruise was only $30 although we wouldn't have minded an charge extra charge for transportation but $20 extra per person was a bit much.\n \nThe next day, we drove 3 hours to Alexandria where we saw the Salamlek Palace and surrounding gardens, Citadel, Alexandria Library, Greco Roman catacombs.  Mohamed offered us a fee-based 30 minute city tour but we declined since we going to drive through the city anyways.\n \nOverall, Mohamed kept us on schedule albeit it was a bit hectic especially for my elderly parents.  Unfortunately, his commentary throughout the two-day tour especially on the long bus ride was very limited.  We had to ask him questions.  We would have enjoyed learning about the rich and amazing history of Egypt. We also did not appreciate being overcharged for the camel ride and dinner cruise, especially since we gave him a very generous 20% tip of the entire tour price for 7 people. His driver was friendly and even offered us tastings of his snacks.","publishedDate":"2012-05-22T06:22:30-04:00","rating":"3","travelDate":"2012-05","user":null,"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"Nile Blue keeps getting better !!!!! 2012","text":"This year we sailed on the Seabourn Quest (Maiden World Cruise) and two of our stops were in Egypt. So what to do? The ships excursions are always soooooooo expensive and large so, we called our friend Hazem, owner of Blue Nile, and told him, seeing that he had handled our excursions in Egypt for the years 2008, 2010, 2011 and now in 2012, we needed his help again. We said, what can you set up for us to see that we have not seen before? When some of the folks, on the ship, heard we were going through Hazem again, a lot of them wanted to be included but, we limit the number of others we allow to go with us. The reason we organize these excursions is because we don't like large groups.  Hazem has never let us down. We had 8 cruisers on an excursion to Luxor where we saw \"The Valley of the Workers\" where most ship excursions don't go. This site is just about as good as \"The Valley of the Kings\" and a lot less people. Hazem also set up a two-hour cruise on the Nile, ending at sunset - what a special time we all had thanks to Hazem. What a thrill, especially with Mohammed as our very knowledgeable guide. Mohammed, whom we have had before as our tour guide, did an outstanding job and all liked him a lot. Our next excursion with Hazem and Nile was Blue was to Alexandria where we had 12 of us.  This time we had Osama as our guide and he was great also. Hazem had set into motion that we would see the Catacombs, the Library and the Rosetta City Houses and Fort.   For some of the other cruisers who could not go with us, we recommended Blue Nile.  They organized their own tours, and all had an outstanding time and praised Hazen and Nile Blue. We highly recommend Nile Blue and Hazem if you want to see the best go Egypt with the best tour guides and reasonable prices.","publishedDate":"2012-05-14T15:55:49-04:00","rating":"5","travelDate":"2012-04","user":null,"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"The most fun we've had on a shore excursion in a long long time!","text":"My husband and I were on a Norwegian Jade cruise stopped at Port Said, Egypt. We hired Nile Blue Excursions (www.nileblueexcursions.com) for a one-day tour of the Pyramids and Nile River Cruise. The Nile Blue Co. provided a comfortable air conditioned van, a wonderful English tour guide named Mohamed, and an excellent driver named Eimen. My husband and I were the only people that signed up for this specific tour that day. They took us all around Giza, explained all about the Pyramids (the Kings and Queens Pyramids),introduced us to their friends the camel caretakers and we went on a stupendous ride of our lifetime on these unique animals out to the back of the pyramids! Then we drove into the city of Cairo for a private lunch (just forthe two of us and our tour guide) on board a private boat down the Nile River! We even took a not-on-the-program stop to the Paprus Institute to get a demonstration of how they make the paper; and we were able to purchase a beautiful piece of art and some paper for us to do oil paintings on. We also got to taste the sweetest red dates that we'v ever had while were there in gypt. What you should take with you on tour are: comfortable shoes and clothing, a camera with a charged batteries! My batteries died just as I was about to ride the camel and I would have missed some great pictures. However, luckily the camel caretakers just happened to have some batteries to sell me; and luckily they didn't overcharge me for them. I would say that the thing tat we liked least is hearing from the people in Egypt that tourism is down since Egypt has had much unrest. The people are suffering and they are looking for a time when they can begin to rebuild and have peace. We thank the Nile Blue Excursion Company, our Tour Guide and our Driver for showing us the highlights of their country, Egypt, and for keeping us safe on our trip to Egypt.","publishedDate":"2011-11-06T10:18:01-05:00","rating":"5","travelDate":"2011-10","user":null,"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"Poor Attention to Detail and Lack of Responsiveness","text":"There were 12 reviews on site, all pretty favorable.

We visited Saquara, a rug factory, Giza, the National Museum, took a Nile lunch cruise, and had a wonderful night at La Meridian after an exquisite bedouin dinner on the hotel grounds.  We were delivered back to our ship in Alexandria the next day in plenty of time.  Those 48 hours were the highlight of our 12 day cruise.\n\nWe loved it so much that just 4 months later, we arranged a 12 day land/Nile cruise for 9 people through Nile Blue.  The program was much more extensive and included 5 nights sailing the Nile on board the ms Nile Dolphin.  Since both Hazem and Ghada are college graduated Egyptologists, it was like having PBS right at our elbows.  They were so amazing in their explainations of everything and arranged for any special requests we had.  One of them was always with us so we never had any fear nor were we left without a translator at any time.  The hotels and meals were well considered and we felt pampered at every turn.

The first time, my husband and I chose to book individual tours, while the next two times our groups ranged from 4 to 12 persons.  We had a wonderful experience in Egypt each time because of Nile Blue’s outstanding service in all aspects of our tours.  Our tour guides, Dalia, Mohammed, and Hazem, were exceptional, giving us great insight into Egyptian history and art.  In terms of price, Nile Blue was much lower than our ship's excursion to Luxor (using the same itinerary and hotel).  We especially like their payment policy, allowing for payment on arrival.  We feel we received excellent value for our money.  Hazem, owner and general manager, and his wife, Ghada, are wonderful people and treated us like family.  On our last trip in April 2011, our cruise line cancelled all ports of call in Egypt due to the recent uprisings and then reinstated the port calls with just 2 days notice.  Nile Blue was amazing in responding to the changes, providing us with outstanding tour guides on the revised dates.  They were very skillful in adjusting our itinerary in Cairo to allow us time in the Egyptian Museum before they drove us off to the Pyramids in sufficient time to avoid a demonstration beginning to take place next to the museum.  We recommend them highly and will certainly use them again.
