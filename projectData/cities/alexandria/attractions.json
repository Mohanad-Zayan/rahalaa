There's also the \"underground part\" (separate from the building itself) which likely once was a collection of jail cells & such judging from its interior architecture although the \"only enclosure\" there is some rectangular area within four walls (which is not underground itself but can only be reached after going through that underground part of the Citadel).\n\nAnd quite conveniently for me staying along the waterfront way Corniche at the time, it was just about a 5-minute taxi ride from near my place to this site, and yes also visible from my balcony was a \"tiny glimpse\" of this building across that small portion of the Mediterranean Sea right past the city's waterfront.","publishedDate":"2022-04-22T10:35:04-04:00","rating":"5","travelDate":"2021-11","user":{"user_id":"B0BEE1C523234EEF41FEED7D4852EDE0","type":"user","first_name":"Myo","last_initial":"M","name":"Myo M","contributions":{"reviews":"954","review_city_count":"0","restaurant_reviews":"6","hotel_reviews":"96","attraction_reviews":"851","helpful_votes":"68","photos_count":"11507","badges_count":"0"},"member_id":"0","username":"Myo M","user_location":{"name":"Coquitlam, Canada","id":"181718"},"avatar":{"small":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1b/ae/cc/93/myo-m.jpg"},"large":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1b/ae/cc/93/myo-m.jpg"}},"link":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.B0BEE1C523234EEF41FEED7D4852EDE0","points":"0","created_time":"2014-04-26T13:48:04-0400","locale":"en_US"},"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"Lovely Sea Fort","text":"This fort was my main reason for coming up to Alexandria, and it did not disappoint.

The Catacombs are a series of underground tombs dating back to the 2nd century AD, and they provide a fascinating glimpse into the funerary customs of ancient Alexandria.\n\nOur guide did an excellent job of explaining the history and significance of the site. The Catacombs themselves are quite extensive, and there is a lot to see, including multiple levels of tombs, an underground cistern, and various statues and carvings. I was especially impressed with the skill and artistry that went into creating these underground tombs.\n\nOne of the most interesting features of the Catacombs is the mix of Egyptian, Greek and Roman architectural styles, which is quite unique. The Catacombs also have a unique blend of Pharaonic, Hellenistic and early Christian motifs, which is quite fascinating to see.\n\nIt's definitely worth a visit if you're interested in ancient history and architecture. The Catacombs of Kom el Shoqafa are not only an important historical site but also a unique and interesting place to explore.","publishedDate":"2023-01-17T18:38:28-05:00","rating":"4","travelDate":"2022-12","user":{"user_id":"4CE9303AB1BC539BE54E9CC848DFF5D6","type":"user","contributions":{"reviews":"3","review_city_count":"0","restaurant_reviews":"1","hotel_reviews":"1","attraction_reviews":"1","helpful_votes":"0","photos_count":"0","badges_count":"0"},"member_id":"0","username":"871shelleyf","user_location":{"name":"Portland, Oregon","id":"52024"},"avatar":{"small":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/e4/a9/default-avatar-2020-50.jpg"},"large":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e4/a9/default-avatar-2020-50.jpg"}},"link":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.4CE9303AB1BC539BE54E9CC848DFF5D6","points":"0","created_time":"2023-01-17T23:03:35-0500","locale":"en_US"},"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"Must Visit!","text":"A must visit site that is fascinating and enjoyable.

And, arriving here just a few days after seeing those \"awesomely beautiful\" tombs of pharaohs in Luxor, I would just describe the tombs at this site as \"pretty plain\" although yes \"somewhat exciting\" was going down the spiral staircase to the underground (seen as just a cylindrical structure from above ground but fairly spacious down below with \"2 levels\") where it was generally worthwhile to see: some tombs with mural scenes & such featuring human & animal figures carved on the exteriors of the tombs, some \"actual remains\" such as human bones displayed in a glass case & some rows of these open-ended square-shaped compartments which likely were once tombs (maybe of those not so high in social hierarchy).  And yes actually, as for the \"stone murals\" (on the exteriors of the tombs as just mentioned), the \"best one\" is not at a tomb below ground but at one above (not a plain mural as those underground but one \"vibrant with colors\").\n\nWith all three sites located just within about a 15-minute taxi ride from one another (including the traffic times in the city streets), I started the day at Roman Theater (just a tiny one with some additional structures around it) then this site followed by Pompey's Pillar (a small hill with a \"commemorative pillar\" & two modest-sized sphinxes with one on each side of the pillar).","publishedDate":"2022-04-30T01:05:30-04:00","rating":"4","travelDate":"2021-11","user":{"user_id":"B0BEE1C523234EEF41FEED7D4852EDE0","type":"user","first_name":"Myo","last_initial":"M","name":"Myo M","contributions":{"reviews":"954","review_city_count":"0","restaurant_reviews":"6","hotel_reviews":"96","attraction_reviews":"851","helpful_votes":"68","photos_count":"11507","badges_count":"0"},"member_id":"0","username":"Myo M","user_location":{"name":"Coquitlam, Canada","id":"181718"},"avatar":{"small":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1b/ae/cc/93/myo-m.jpg"},"large":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1b/ae/cc/93/myo-m.jpg"}},"link":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.B0BEE1C523234EEF41FEED7D4852EDE0","points":"0","created_time":"2014-04-26T13:48:04-0400","locale":"en_US"},"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"Really worth a visit","text":"Out of all the attractions in Alexandria we found this one to be the most interesting.

The modern library is a nod to the cultural heritage of Alexandria, which had a reputation as a center of learning in ancient times.\n\nThe building's architecture and design are noteworthy, and the collection of books, manuscripts, and other resources is extensive. The library also features interactive exhibits and innovative technologies that make the collection accessible to visitors. It is important to note that access to the library is restricted to children under the age of 4.\n\nWhether you are a student, researcher, or simply interested in learning, the Bibliotheca Alexandrina is worth a visit. Its blend of history, culture, and technology make it a unique experience.\n\nIn conclusion, if you are in Alexandria and meet the age requirements, I recommend checking out the Bibliotheca Alexandrina. The library's collection and facilities will give you a deeper appreciation for the city's cultural heritage.","publishedDate":"2023-02-11T22:57:37-05:00","rating":"4","travelDate":"2023-02","user":{"user_id":"208E4B1B01926EC2DD5C7F220EBE905F","type":"user","contributions":{"reviews":"8","review_city_count":"0","restaurant_reviews":"0","hotel_reviews":"6","attraction_reviews":"2","helpful_votes":"0","photos_count":"0","badges_count":"0"},"member_id":"0","username":"fahdnaitali","user_location":{"name":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","id":"295424"},"avatar":{"small":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/28/2a/c0/b7/fahdnaitali.jpg"},"large":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/28/2a/c0/b7/fahdnaitali.jpg"}},"link":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.208E4B1B01926EC2DD5C7F220EBE905F","points":"0","created_time":"2018-04-16T00:09:12-0400","locale":"en_US"},"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"A modern library in front of the Mediterranean","text":"Though I didn’t go inside realizing my time drawing short as the sun sets, I can see the fusion of cultures and telling people what they want to convey.","publishedDate":"2023-02-08T19:18:18-05:00","rating":"5","travelDate":"2023-01","user":{"user_id":"36B6AD435D6A9CFF511FBB8ABC1976E5","type":"user","contributions":{"reviews":"4","review_city_count":"0","restaurant_reviews":"0","hotel_reviews":"0","attraction_reviews":"4","helpful_votes":"0","photos_count":"0","badges_count":"0"},"member_id":"0","username":"keishakorvinus","user_location":{"name":"United Arab Emirates","id":"294012"},"avatar":{"small":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/f6/0d/default-avatar-2020-34.jpg"},"large":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f6/0d/default-avatar-2020-34.jpg"}},"link":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.36B6AD435D6A9CFF511FBB8ABC1976E5","points":"0","created_time":"2023-01-16T01:22:02-0500","locale":"en_US"},"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"Highlight of our trip!

So instead we went downstairs and went through one of their exhibitions (the antiquities), which was fascinating.  Then we headed up for the tour.  Our guide was super engaging and walked us through the many aspects of the library, from its construction, remote access of books and information, permanent displays, etc...\n\nWe then walked around and explored the main library itself.

It features the remains of an ancient Roman theater, Auditoria (lecture halls), Roman baths, cisterns and a small village. The Villa of the Birds is located here. The name was given to the remains of what was once the large house of a wealthy Roman. Dating to the reign of Hadrian, the restored villa has a stunning mosaic floor depicting colorful birds. An elevated walkway provides a viewing platform. The entire site, including the theater, is on the small side but worth the admission fee. We visited with a guide, but the site is well-marked with descriptive plaques, so you could manage here on your own. There were only a few other people strolling the grounds when we visited (and several wild dogs that gave me quite a scare). By the way, like the typical Roman theater, look for the small area center stage that marks the location where your voice is amplified and carries to the whole theater (try this, it's remarkable!).","publishedDate":"2020-05-08T10:35:46-04:00","rating":"4","travelDate":"2020-02","user":{"user_id":"DF4D760647029B1DD8DE38B75FC501A0","type":"user","first_name":"Linda","last_initial":"Y","name":"Linda Y","contributions":{"reviews":"1204","review_city_count":"0","restaurant_reviews":"187","hotel_reviews":"105","attraction_reviews":"912","helpful_votes":"2","photos_count":"1097","badges_count":"0"},"member_id":"0","username":"Linda Y","user_location":{"name":"Frisco, Texas","id":"55870"},"avatar":{"small":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/0f/05/8c/77/linda-y.jpg"},"large":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/0f/05/8c/77/linda-y.jpg"}},"link":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.DF4D760647029B1DD8DE38B75FC501A0","points":"0","created_time":"2009-10-04T16:05:36-0400","locale":"en_US"},"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"Kom El-Dekka Site (Roman amphitheater) well worth a look!","text":"Kom El-Dekka Site (Roman amphitheater) is in Alexandria - founded by Alexander the Great.

The museum showcases an impressive collection of jewelry and other precious artifacts that depict the rich history and culture of Egypt.\n\nUnfortunately, the museum staff were not available during my visit, but the self-guided tour allowed me to explore the exhibits at my own pace. Despite this, the museum was well-organized and provided ample information about the pieces on display, making it easy to understand the significance of each piece.\n\nThe museum is beautifully arranged and the attention to detail in preserving the pieces was evident. Whether you're a fan of history, culture, or jewelry, the Royal Jewelry Museum is definitely worth a visit.\n\nIn conclusion, I highly recommend the Royal Jewelry Museum in Alexandria to anyone who is interested in learning more about the history and culture of Egypt. The self-guided tour may have been a challenge, but the collection on display was truly captivating.","publishedDate":"2023-02-11T22:52:09-05:00","rating":"4","travelDate":"2023-02","user":{"user_id":"208E4B1B01926EC2DD5C7F220EBE905F","type":"user","contributions":{"reviews":"8","review_city_count":"0","restaurant_reviews":"0","hotel_reviews":"6","attraction_reviews":"2","helpful_votes":"0","photos_count":"0","badges_count":"0"},"member_id":"0","username":"fahdnaitali","user_location":{"name":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","id":"295424"},"avatar":{"small":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/28/2a/c0/b7/fahdnaitali.jpg"},"large":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/28/2a/c0/b7/fahdnaitali.jpg"}},"link":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.208E4B1B01926EC2DD5C7F220EBE905F","points":"0","created_time":"2018-04-16T00:09:12-0400","locale":"en_US"},"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"Enjoyable visit","text":"Interesting building and lots of jewelry on display.

We may have just been lucky, but when we visited there the other day (July 2021), windows were open and cooling breezes were blowing through almost all of the building. To ensure you have a comfortable visit, why not just go early in the day? They open at nine a.m.\n\nI won't bother with all the details of what's included: the facts are elsewhere for you to read. It's an important place in Alexandria history, truly beautiful, and it was actually a residence for many years. \n\nIf you, like I and so many others have, fall in love with the exceptional tilework in the royal bathroom, then be sure to take a peek through the beveled glass doors to the right, looking up from bottom of the staircase on the first floor. You should be able to see some different exceptionall tiles, in an area which must be part of the kitchen. It wasn't open to the public when we visited, so it's a bit of a teaser, once you've seen that gorgeous bathroom. \n\nPerhaps the museum offers a place for refreshments in non-covid times, but nothing like that was open on the premises when we were there. We gave ourselves a nice post-museum break at the Cilantro cafe, around the corner and down the block. Ecuador, across the tram line from the museum, is very good too.

Me and my wife were spellbound by that scene, by naive, sort of childish faces so unusual for us Russians to see on an icon and decided to dig a little bit deeper. \nNow we know much more about the Copts and when planning a trip to Egypt could not afford to miss St Mina Monastery - it was him depicted on that icon. I'd abstain from describing his life and martyrdom here but one thing is certain - it is one of numerous albeit much less known gems of this country.\nThough situated not that far from Alexandria, it is not so easy to find since there are no signs in English. So use your GPS - or take a local guide.\nThe complex is heavily guarded because of muslim fanatics' attacks on the Copts several years ago (no worries - now it's safe there) but it is calm and piety that reign inside. Spacious, impeccably clean, elegant landscape design, imposing architecture, serious but good-natured monks. Quite by chance we met the father superior - an old grey-haired man with a beard - and he gracefully told us the story of the place.\nThe main church is naturally Orthodox but differs so much from the tradition we are used to in Russia. Nevertheless, you literally feel Divine Grace coming upon you there and leave the complex light and peaceful.\nWe loved every moment of that visit.\nIt is the largest Coptic monastery in Egypt, by the way.

The monastery is located at a place in the Western Desert that Saint Mina was buried circa 3rd, 4th century AD. The place used to be desert but with the spread of irrigation from the Nile river, the area is now becoming agricultural ( so don't expect to see sweeping sand dunes). The monastery is a large compound surrounded by high walls and is dominated by a church that is dedicated to St. Mina. There is a chapel on one side of the cathedral  where the remains of St. Mina are interred. \n\nThe monastery is about 90 minute drive from Alexandria and probably about 2.5 to 3 hours from Cairo. If you go from Alexandria take the slightly longer desert road to avoid the Lake Mariout industrial area of Alexandria (the backside of Alex which is not very picturesque). \n\nWithin the compound there is the cathedral to St. Mina, as well as an area with shops stalls that sells religious items and local food, desert plants, and a guest house that serves free bowls of foul (beans) and tea to all visitors - no questions asked and they are very generous. The foul and tea are very clean and tasty. Apparently this is common practice at all Egyptian Monasteries that are open to tourists, i.e. you are treated as a pilgrim and food and drink is provided for free.\n\nThe cathedral is very impressive and has some very intricate art work and murals. This is all modern art that was built in the last 40 years under the patronage of the last Coptic Pope, who was the driving force behind the construction of the monastery, and he is interred in the crypt at the back of the cathedral. \n\nOne of the monks speaks English very well and can give tours of the cathedral. . \n\nNext to the monastery, about 500 meters out into the desert are the archaeological remains of the Byzantine church that was built for St. Mina.  You need a car or be prepared for about a 30 minute walk to reach the site. It is not well marked so you would need someone to show you how to reach the ruins. \n\nThe archaeological site is guarded by a group of Coptic men (and their 4 watch dogs) and they are also tour guides. You would need a Egyptian speaker guide to help with the translations there. \n\nThe whole place is very well maintained and there is no tipping accepted by anyone (even the guys out at the archaeological site would not take tips) . If you would like to give donations then you can give directly to the Monks. They are willing to accept donations for the poor.","publishedDate":"2016-01-04T06:57:39-05:00","rating":"5","travelDate":"2015-12","user":{"user_id":"8851C0A36F3015ADB0C3F92BFA135F5F","type":"user","contributions":{"reviews":"14","review_city_count":"0","restaurant_reviews":"2","hotel_reviews":"7","attraction_reviews":"5","helpful_votes":"3","photos_count":"24","badges_count":"0"},"member_id":"0","username":"pjshannon7","user_location":{"name":"Brussels, Belgium","id":"188644"},"avatar":{"small":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/2e/70/88/avatar009.jpg"},"large":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/01/2e/70/88/avatar009.jpg"}},"link":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.8851C0A36F3015ADB0C3F92BFA135F5F","points":"0","created_time":"2010-04-21T10:09:40-0400","locale":"en_US"},"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"Peace and inspiration !","text":"Peace and calm place .. very inspirational and worth a visit to see the cathedral and all the churches over there and the be blessed with this amazing HOLY place.\nyou can also do some shopping .. souvenirs and holy stuff as well nevertheless they serve some food as well.","publishedDate":"2015-12-11T22:17:10-05:00","rating":"4","travelDate":"2015-10","user":{"user_id":"FE9B90CAB9A536D7BC3282951FC0456D","type":"user","contributions":{"reviews":"63","review_city_count":"0","restaurant_reviews":"13","hotel_reviews":"15","attraction_reviews":"35","helpful_votes":"0","photos_count":"77","badges_count":"0"},"member_id":"0","username":"Michaelrizk","user_location":{"name":"Cairo, Egypt","id":"294201"},"avatar":{"small":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/09/c0/12/6b/michaelrizk.jpg"},"large":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/09/c0/12/6b/michaelrizk.jpg"}},"link":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.FE9B90CAB9A536D7BC3282951FC0456D","points":"0","created_time":"2009-12-26T07:52:22-0500","locale":"en_US"},"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"Great Blessing","text":"It was a great blessing to visit it after so many years, lots of new building and a new and beautiful church or I may say Cathedral.","publishedDate":"2015-08-10T15:08:16-04:00","rating":"5","travelDate":"2015-07","user":{"user_id":"FDE929015D6A3317CEA878CB020B5A1F","type":"user","first_name":"Emad","last_initial":"M","name":"Emad M","contributions":{"reviews":"111","review_city_count":"0","restaurant_reviews":"16","hotel_reviews":"47","attraction_reviews":"48","helpful_votes":"20","photos_count":"5","badges_count":"0"},"member_id":"0","username":"Emad M","user_location":{"name":"Edmonton, Canada","id":"154914"},"avatar":{"small":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/18/54/8b/a7/emad-10.jpg"},"large":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/18/54/8b/a7/emad-10.jpg"}},"link":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.FDE929015D6A3317CEA878CB020B5A1F","points":"0","created_time":"2010-08-27T13:00:34-0400","locale":"en_US"},"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"Very inspirational place","text":"Very good maintained religious complex with friendly atmosphere.

St. Mark moved to Alexandria later in his ministry and founded the first Church of Alexandria around 50 AD. The lovely church you see today, built in 1952, stands on the same site.  St Mark was martyred in 68 AD and a miraculous storm prevented the pagans from burning his body. The Christians were then able to carry him away and bury him in a cave under the church. It is said that the saint’s body was stolen in 828 AD and taken to Venice, but other relics remain in the church. Our guide asked a church caregiver to unlock the entrance to the crypt for us. We passed through a vestibule decorated with mosaics describing St. Mark’s life. Steps then descended to a hallway where we could peer through a window to a shrine and relics of the saint. I had not expected this, what a surprise!

Some of the info here is incorrect. After The King was kicked out of Egyptian 1952 by Nasser , they turned the main building into a museum to show the Egyptian people how rich and corrupt the King was while his people were poor. I remember being there in 1959 to 1964 , as we lived in Alexandria. They showed off his stamp collection , coin collection etc etc. In late 60s and 1970  they used it to run concerts by Egyptian rock bands \"Black Coats\" and \"le petit chat\". As for the 365 wives, not quite correct. Farouk was a Womanizer and had a separate smaller building for his lady friends which is open today as a hotel. Farouk was also a kleptomaniac.  He drove around Alexandsria in a red convertable and no one else was allowed a red car as he wanted people to know it was him. Then Sadat closed it down in the 70s as he believed it was disrespectful. After Sadat came Mubarak who used it as a guest house for himself and diplomats. The main building has been closed the past 20 years and just sitting there gathering dust. The grounds have alwasy been open to the public. I have an old video from 1959 running around as a 4 year old in the balcony. Good old days.

There are two underground sections (only one was open on my visit) and considerable restoration has been done, with a lot of concrete used. Enter the doors and down about 25 steps to get to the subterranean rto see the rock-hewn tombs. There are some coloured wall paintings visible alongside remains of small sphinxes. Outside there is a small garden area with a large sarcophagus in good condition. There is another section of tombs that are open to the elements and these are in particularly poor condition. It is just about possible to see the cuttings into the sandstone rock where the coffins were put. The dead have long since been removed from these tombs.\nThe garden has aloes, fig tree and a few nice plants but there is nowhere for visitors to sit, so you don't feel encouraged to linger. \nIt was a little disappointing, but definitely worth seeing if you are in the area. Some of the relics found here have been moved to museums.

I posted some of the sad picture we took. And following some short info about what Antoniadis was: \n\nThe history of The Villa of Antoniadis goes back to Mohamed Ali era. It is a very famous and important site in Alexandria. A wealthy palace for a once-wealthy group, Villa Antoniadis still remains an exclusive place, it includes statues and a tropical greenhouse. The house itself is surrounded by the Antoniadis Gardens, the Flower Garden, the Zoo and Nozha Gardens. Driving past now on the way to the airport, the tall royal palms and stone pines give just a glimpse of the rare and precious trees which were gathered to fill the garden, and yet it's one of the least visited attractions of Alexandria.\nAfterwards, it was used as a guest house to host visiting dignitaries to Egypt, including the King of Belgium, Greece, Italy, the Shah of Iran and Mohamed Reza Pahlavi, who was married to the Egyptian Princess Fawzia, the sister of King Farouk. The Villa also hosted the signing ceremony of the 1936 agreement between Egypt and Britain, which gave Egypt some limited independence, and it held the first meeting of the Egyptian Olympia committee.

Not only is the collection excellent, and varied -- ranging from fifteenth century Dutch painting to 20th century Egyptian works -- but the presentation in this recently refurbished building is also decent. The descriptions could be more detailed and complete, but this hardly detracts from the artworks themselves. High points are the small group of paintings by Giambattista Tiepolo (!!!), and an interesting selection of Orientalist works. Eighteenth and ninteteenth century European art is represented mainly through the works of minor artists, which are worth a look nonetheless. On the upper floor, there is a large selection of modern Egyptian art, including works by foreign born artists active in Egypt (e.g. Thalia Flora-Karavia), and several smaller works by Moukhtar. Entrance to the museum is free; this is an absolute must for every art lover.","publishedDate":"2018-04-08T11:18:38-04:00","rating":"5","travelDate":"2018-04","user":{"user_id":"F65BD2E86E170468D2AB9785417C9A95","type":"user","contributions":{"reviews":"4","review_city_count":"0","restaurant_reviews":"1","hotel_reviews":"0","attraction_reviews":"3","helpful_votes":"0","photos_count":"6","badges_count":"0"},"member_id":"0","username":"T5964ISmarkm","user_location":{},"avatar":{"small":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1c/38/84/6a/mark-m.jpg"},"large":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1c/38/84/6a/mark-m.jpg"}},"link":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.F65BD2E86E170468D2AB9785417C9A95","points":"0","created_time":"2018-04-08T14:57:18-0400","locale":"en_US"},"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"Specially for Art Lovers .","text":"When you have a day in Alexandria , you literally forget the fact that you are in Egypt .

Was mich mehr beeindruckt hat, ist das Museum für arabische Kalligraphie, das sich gleich nebenan befindet und dazu gehört.

a real village poor part of town ","text":"If you don't have a tour guide with you don't even bother going to this place because you won't be able to distinguish the pieces.  There is  so many different artifacts and they all look similar. \n\nThey charge two EP for parking and don't allow digital cameras inside- cell phones are ok. This is in a  poor part of town so don't be alarmed . The bathrooms are disgusting and are not equipped with toilet paper so bring tissue or tip the lady outside the restroom for some of hers... I highly recommend not using the facilities at all. \nMy favorite part was the underground sand built mummies tombs. You take 99 steps down into mummy storage. It's scary cool and even the air is different . Just don't think about earthquakes  while you're under there.\n\nThroughout our time in Egypt we used a tour guide we met at the museum he speaks Italian, English, some Russian and of course Arabic. He has very reasonable prices and knows the history of Egypt very well -he has the answers to everything and we had many questions. From Cairo to Alexandra we gave him 150usd, for several attractions and some mall shopping, this was an all day trip. If you want his information  contact me. \n\nPrior to meeting him we had two other guides. they were overpriced and taking us to places where they would benefit, pressuring us into purchasing items etc. they were arranged via the hotel. \nMy guy is far better!

It was pretty cool if you enjoy that but you need imagination! Otherwise its all covered in barnacles and not much fish.\n\nPharos Island\nLess interesting just rocks and quite a bit of finishing lines. Didn’t see much and the visibility was around 1m.\n\nTwo dives in half day but a few words of advice:\n1 bring some food for between dives you’ll be out on the boat most of the day.\n2 Bring your passport!! I forgot and being Egypt there are a lot of government permissions to go through. Ahmed kindly took me back to my hotel to grab it.\n3 be prepared to go with the flow it’s Egypt things take a while just relax and enjoy the day\n\nFYI: They are the only recreational scuba company left in Alexandria as the government closed the others due to unsafe practices.\n\nIn 2yrs once Frank Goddios team finish They hope to offer dives to Heraclion site which is quite exciting hopefully the government will keep some of the finds in the sea.","publishedDate":"2022-10-20T07:17:13-04:00","rating":"4","travelDate":"2022-10","user":{"user_id":"E414685D7ABB2B2650C4DFEFC30E0FF2","type":"user","first_name":"Jade","last_initial":"A","name":"Jade A","contributions":{"reviews":"78","review_city_count":"0","restaurant_reviews":"30","hotel_reviews":"24","attraction_reviews":"24","helpful_votes":"30","photos_count":"10","badges_count":"0"},"member_id":"0","username":"Jade A","user_location":{"name":"London, United Kingdom","id":"186338"},"avatar":{"small":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/27/fe/38/18/jade-a.jpg"},"large":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/27/fe/38/18/jade-a.jpg"}},"link":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.E414685D7ABB2B2650C4DFEFC30E0FF2","points":"0","created_time":"2008-11-21T05:09:39-0500","locale":"en_US"},"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"Diving in Alexandria","text":"Nice staff.

modern Egyptian art in the basement, the Mahmoud Said museum on the ground floor, and the Adham and Seid Wanly museum on the upper floor (accessible through a separate door to the left of the main entrance).\n\nThe first provides an overview of main trends in Egyptian painting since the early 1900s, with some notable works particularly for the first half of the 20th century. The Mahmoud Said museum has a representative collection of his work, including his nudes, but this reviewer finds the landscape paintings (first room right) to be of particular interest. \n\nThe Wanly brothers museum is the real revelation: I was not familiar with the work of either prior to my visit, and was stunned to find their work incredibly interesting, and varied. The early character studies in the first hall are wonderful, as are the late, dreamlike landscapes. In the main hall. \n\nThis is world class art, and it is a pity that the Wanly brothers are not celebrated with greater fanfare as major artists. \n\nIn any other country, there would be books, posters, postcards mugs and umbrellas with reproductions of their work in a museum gift shop. More importantly, there would be classes of school children in the museum, families and young couples. \n\nPart of the problem is the museum's location, hidden from view in a side street behind the towering San Stefano mall. You are more likely to find it if you look for the delivery entrance of the Fathallah supermarket. \n\nEntrance is free. This is one of the most important collections in Egypt -- if you like art, don't miss it.","publishedDate":"2018-07-10T22:04:22-04:00","rating":"5","travelDate":"2018-06","user":{"user_id":"F65BD2E86E170468D2AB9785417C9A95","type":"user","contributions":{"reviews":"4","review_city_count":"0","restaurant_reviews":"1","hotel_reviews":"0","attraction_reviews":"3","helpful_votes":"0","photos_count":"6","badges_count":"0"},"member_id":"0","username":"T5964ISmarkm","user_location":{},"avatar":{"small":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1c/38/84/6a/mark-m.jpg"},"large":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1c/38/84/6a/mark-m.jpg"}},"link":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/MemberProfile-a_uid.F65BD2E86E170468D2AB9785417C9A95","points":"0","created_time":"2018-04-08T14:57:18-0400","locale":"en_US"},"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"Don't

Enjoy a different experience and travel with your imagination.","text":"Does it worth the visit? ABSOLUTELY!!\nNevertheless, you need to stretch your imagination and understand that an open archaeological site is not meant to be as fancy as a musuem. \n\nThe tombs are five in number, however I & II are the most important. They belong to the first half of the 3rd century BC. Imagine getting a glimpse of the glam of these days. The tombs are a perfect example of the mélange between Greek and Egyptian decorative motifs during the early Hellenistic era.\n\nThe tombs are famous between archaeologists for being cut in the rock, havig rich colourful ceilings and walls, and for their incrustation style (faux-marble); which is a pure Hellenistic invention. It stands for the treatment of plaques to imitate marble wherever it's a rare material, the case in Alexandria and Cyprus. Moreover, tomb II is famous for its colourful scenes of the purification of the deceased. \n\nThe site is rich and it gives a vivid space to stretch imagination and visualise how rich and special these early tombs could have looked back on their day.\n\nSaint Genis who accompanied Napoleon to Egypt (there is a square named after him in Alexandria) described a Necropolis in the western part of the Pharos island with rock-cut catacombs consisting of numerous interconnected chambers with plastered and painted walls and ceilings,then partly filled with sand, which must have been either Anfoushi or Ras El-Tin (In the gardens of the palace of Ras El-Tin and is not opened to the public).\n\nI totally recommend for those who are into getting exposed to a different kind of excursions.

The tombs are hewn from sandstone rock which is weathered. Some tombs are above current ground level and others below (partly flooded). There was rubbish/litter/garbage around the site including plastic food wrappers which deterred me from taking photos in some cases. It is not possible to enter any of the underground sections. The site is larger than Mustafa Kamel Necropolis. There is a pleasant garden and shaded seating around. There are sections of columns and parts of statues on display as well, including two headless sphinxes. There are no signs or guidance of any kind for visitors.\nSeveral beautiful items found at this site can be seen in the Alexandria National Museum and for that reason alone I htink this site is worth a visit.

terrific for male groups, OK for conservative families, Bad for female groups and females in a bikini and 1 piece","text":"It was relatively easy to find once we knew it was on the side heading to Alexandria, so we started from Alexandria heading to Cairo, after Alexandria's Gate by about 4 km we took a U turn and we found it on our right.\n\nWe found free parking and at the gate we paid 90 Pounds each Including lunch and all Water park games, We also paid a 1 time fee 25 pounds Rent for the big round floater which is used at the big water slide only and all of our group shared this floater many times during the day we would take turns\n\nwe arrived at 9:30 am it was pretty empty and enjoyable\n\nthere was 5 nice pools avg 1 meter deep, only 1 pool was 1.5 Meters deep which is the max there\n\nThere is also a pool that have waves in it which is enjoyable for some time before it gets crowded.\n\nThere are 3 slides there for adults and kids older than 15 Years old, there are for small kids but I didn't pay attention to those since we didn't have kids with us.\n\nThe 3 slides are as follows:\n    1- Big black tube that is fully covered like a pipe has an average drop at it's start and has some turns later, this one you have the option of using a floater in and it is quite more enjoyable with the floater so don't miss out on it. you can go on your back or stomach.\n    2- In the middle there is the straight white slide which is very very very fast and straight forward but also quite enjoyable for more than a few times, but this one is operated from 4 pm until the end of the day at 6:30 pm, you can only go on your back in this one.\n    3- There is the half pipe white one operated from opening until 4 pm only, this one is enjoyable too for a few times, this one has some turns and you can go on your back or stomach.\n\nuntil 10:30 am ~ 11 am everything was quite fun and smooth but then people started coming in and it became too crowded and you had to wait for 20 minutes to get on any slide.\n\nafter 5:30 pm it was relatively empty again and you can go on slides directly\n\nThe reason they switch between those slides i think is because they only have 2 water compressor pumps which is needed to operate the slides so at 4 pm they switch.\n\nat 3 pm there is a break until 4 pm.\n\nThe quality of people there makes it hard for females to enjoy this attraction specially if they are attractive and/or wearing non conservative swim suite.\n\nSo if you have a family with small kids or you are a group of guys you will have amazing fun, if you a group of guys and girls / family of guys and girls then you will also have fun but make sure no bikinis or one piece swimsuits only full body swim suites.\n\nP.S. like any water parks or pools you can only go into the water if you are wearing swim suites, NO COTTON NO JEANS!\n\nI hope this is helpful for others, have a great time on your next trip","publishedDate":"2015-06-28T12:10:55-04:00","rating":"3","travelDate":"2015-06","user":{"user_id":"5AE11314EA992A6B05F1B1B9F62FD81F","type":"user","contributions":{"reviews":"38","review_city_count":"0","restaurant_reviews":"9","hotel_reviews":"7","attraction_reviews":"22","helpful_votes":"6","photos_count":"25","badges_count":"0"},"member_id":"0","username":"Shereef-Marzouk","user_location":{"name":"Bedford,
