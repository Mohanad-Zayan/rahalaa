stayed here last week for a 2 night stay as part of an Intrepid Basix Tour through Jordan and Egypt.  \n\nI really liked this hotel. It is a basic accommodation and should be reviewed as such.  The rooms were big and clean with a cute balcony (great view) and I never had an issue with hot water.  \n\nThe pool area was very nice and loved sitting, relaxing and watching the sunrise.\n\nThe breakfast was not the greatest but there are plenty of very cheap options nearby. ( Yum Yums was my favourite!!)\n\nWIFI in Egypt in general is not the greatest so I have a Vodophone SIM to use when I come to Egypt.  250LE will set you up nicely for where ever you go. \n\nThe service was excellent.  The staff were kind and courteous and their English was great.\n\nI loved that it was located on the walkway that can take you essentially anywhere in Dahab.  I love to walk so this is an added bonus.\n\nI recommend this property to those that enjoy an authentic experience rather then luxury and I will personally stay here again.\n","title":"2 Night

Two single beds (linen and towels provided), a desk, two chairs, mirror, bedside table, wardrobe, bathroom is fine, balcony is a nice place to relax. Wi-fi is decent most of the time.

So we got in a fight with the other guest and decided to do a 3 day trip to the desert and other places and then return when the other guest would be gone.\n\nThe theft of the food didn't stop and we soon realized it was the personnel them self taking guests food from the common kitchen. \nWe complained about this and also that the wifi always was down. Jamar explained that wifi was down in all of Dahab. We told him this wasn't true because it worked fine everywhere else. So his solution to the problem was that he thought that we could go to the other places and use their wifi. We said that that was a ridiculous idea and that he should just fix their wifi. He then went into a frenzy and asked us to stop complaining about everything. We thought it was just fare to point out that our stuff was stolen and that the wifi, that is included in the price, didn't work. \n\nThere is so much negative things to write about the place so i will try to be as short as I can but it wont.\n\nThe personell didn't do any of their tasks unless the owner were there. Then they were all over the place, cleaning the rooms, the common places, painting the walls etc. However when he wasn't there they were just a bunch of useless sitting around taking up the guests space, smoking and drinking coffe all the time. They weren't friendly and Jamar were even hostile at times. He was really the core problem of the whole camp. The guest there was great people but he made sure to talk bad- about everyone and try to turn other guest around each other (our example: the false accusation about the guest stealing from us). He even talked ill about the fantastic cat lady who only did good for the community and the camp. Everyone adored her and he couldn't stand someone doing better for his country.\n\nBecause the workers didn't do any work we the guest our self had to do alla the work. The only one in the work force who really did some of the work was Mohammed who were really friendly and tried to help out and stop Jamars shenanigans.\n\nThe rooms were cheap but not clean. We had to clean our own rooms. \nI would so much more recommend the other fighting Kangaroo camp where we moved over to, after being threatened by Jamar who took a frying pan and hit it in the table! where me, my wife and two other people sat and ate breakfast, because he thought we had made a mess in the kitchen. We had spend the entire morning cleaning the camp.\nAfter that we immediately packed our things and left. \n\nAlso, he was threatening everyone that he got in an argue with that he would call the police on them. What the police would do under the different circumstances that occurred were very unclear. Of course he never called the police.\n\nA beautiful camp but with a really hostile environment that just makes you want to cut your vacation short.\n\nThanks for listening and please, for your sake, stay at another camp.

Чистый, спокойный, уютный отель. Первая линия, небольшой номерной фонд, туристов практически не было, в бассейне плавали одни, на пляже тоже отдыхали одни. \nМаксимально романтинческий и уединённый отдых получился, чему мы были несказанно рады. \nОчень вкусно кормят, чистая посуда, всегда все убирается-вытирается во время, никакие мухи над грязными тарелками не летают, как это бывает в больших отелях. \nПерсонал максимально вежливый и дружелюбный, всегда помогут, подскажут, посоветуют. Вкусные смузи подают в баре у бассейна (за отдельную плату).\nЕдинственная претензия по персоналу так это к ресепшену. Ресепшен не предупреждает о том, что в море без специальной обуви заходить опасно, как итог - мой муж наступил на морского ежа,\n и как потом выяснилось их на этом пляже немеренное количество. Оставшиеся дни мы были очень внимательны и уже плавали в специальных ботинках, \nно все равно каждый раз изучали дно, чтобы можно было безопасно поставить ногу.\nАнимации нет, но она нам была и не нужна. Мы хотели как раз таки спокойного романтического отпуска лишь для нас двоих.\nВид из окна номера был прекрасный. Море-горы - глазу есть где разгуляться. Шикарные большие балконы в номерах, уборка каждые 3 дня, ну либо по требованию.\nМинус: из крана течет соленая вода, кажется морская. Бедные мои волосы, которых после моря я получается снова мыла морской водой, но уже в номере отеля.\nИтог: Это лучший отель из всех где я только была в своей жизни!

wonderful hotel, especially if you want to go diving. I could nit-pick about a few things but on the whole I was really happy here for two weeks. It's not 5 star so manage your expectations but it's a great hotel. The staff make it really special and will go out of their way to help you. Some niggles I had with the room were sorted out very quickly, simply the remote controls not working. The bathroom could have done with a face lift and the showerhead wasn't great, but it was usable and I got used to it after a couple of days.

Happy life is very peaceful, chilled out and laid back place. \nIt is set in a stunning location in South Dahab with gorgeous views of red mountains behind. The house reef is also great for snorkeling, teaming with colourful corals and marine life. \nThe rooms are a generous size, comfortable and have all you need.\nThe food is of a really good standard. Having been to various hotels in Sharm el Sheikh with a higher star rating than Happy Life, I've still found Happy Life's food to be of better quality, standard and choice than other hotels I've experienced in Egypt.\nHaving visited this hotel so often I've seen staff come and go through the years, but there are a core who have remained. \n\nNumber 1... Mohammed  ( manager of the restaurant) who many returning tourist mention time and again, and hold in high regard for being exceptionally helpful, very efficient, very friendly and kind and has time for everyone, staff and guests. He keeps the restaurant running like clock work, regarding staff, appreance of the restaurant and good quality of food. \n\nMina and Samir are also staff who have been there for years, who will greet you on arrival and take your luggage to your room, 2 exceptionally pleasant guys that I'm always happy to see on my returning visits. \n\nYears gone by the WiFi used to be very intermittent, which was frustrating, but it has improved so much recently. Now able to get wifi most of the time at the reception area for free. This is always important to guests. \n\nQuads bike trips are on offer at the hotel for a good price, Samy will ensure you have a memorable time on your quad bike offering a few different special locations.\n\nGamal an older security guy doesn't speak a word of English, works hard at doing a great job of ensuring the safety of tourists on the beach. I've know him since day dot, I have a massive soft spot and big respect for him. \n\nThe hotel put on a free shuttle bus service to and from Dahab which allows time to enjoy shops, bars and cafes if tourists a change of scene. \n\nMy time is spent chilling on the beach, soaking up the gorgeous scenery and enjoying the peace and quiet, while dipping in and out the sea for a snorkel now and again. There is something special about this place that will always pull me back and many other returning guests. I recommend this hotel hugely for location, outstanding friendly, helpful staff, good quality food and a total chill out.\n\nThanks also to Mr Mohab one of the mangers, who I've know for years who keeps the place running well and is always friendly to me. Look forward to being here again very shorty. \n\nThanks everyone at Happy life for always making my holidays here amazing👊🏽🌞⭐️🌠🌚🐠🐡🐟🌅\n\n","title":"2nd home and first class hotel","subratings":[],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false},{"id":"877308156","lang":"en","location_id":"460109","published_date":"2023-02-03T05:57:10-05:00","published_platform":"Mobile","rating":"5","type":"review","helpful_votes":"0","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297547-d460109-r877308156-Happy_Life_Village-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review877308156","travel_date":"2023-01","text":"We stayed at this wonderful hotel.

The only issue I have is the front desk seems clueless. I booked a massage but they didn’t ask my name or room number. They needed to cancel the massage bc the masseuse’s son was sick, but couldn’t figure out how to reach me. When I showed up, they didn’t apologize or make an attempt to book another masseuse. I asked for a time the next day and For some unknown reason, they then booked me at 7am the next morning without asking me. \nWhen I expressed concerns that her son may have Covid, they said it was impossible because there’s no Covid in Egypt and even asked me if I actually knew anyone that had gotten it (and why yes, my dad with stage 4 cancer did in fact have Covid at that time). It felt aggressive and at very least unprofessional. \nWhen I came back to book for a third time, a different front desk person asked if I was still mad, and when I said it was disappointing and unprofessional, easily avoidable, she said that I should be happy and she lives her life happy, which was an odd, passive aggressive (?) response. \nI wish I could say it was all worth it but after all that,  the massage was just OK. She used her elbows a lot but was not particularly mindful about speed and location of the pressure.","title":"Awful customer service","subratings":[],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false}],"location":{"coordinates":["28.491682","34.513824"],"address":"Mashraba Palm Tree Garden, Dahab 46617 Egypt"}},{"id":"561592","type":"HOTEL","name":"Dive Urge","image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/17/b5/da/beautiful-beachthe-palm.jpg","awards":[],"rankingPosition":"1","priceLevel":"$","priceRange":"$70 - $88","category":"hotel","rating":5,"hotelClass":"0.0","phone":"+20 100 715 1459","email":"info@dive-urge.com","amenities":[],"numberOfRooms":8,"prices":[],"webUrl":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297547-d561592-Reviews-Dive_Urge-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html","website":"http://www.dive-urge.com","rankingString":"#1 of 60 B&Bs / Inns in Dahab","rankingDenominator":"60","numberOfReviews":270,"reviews":[{"id":"875821789","lang":"en","location_id":"561592","published_date":"2023-01-21T02:50:29-05:00","published_platform":"Desktop","rating":"5","type":"review","helpful_votes":"0","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297547-d561592-r875821789-Dive_Urge-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review875821789","travel_date":"2023-01","text":"Where to start....we had planned this trip for a long while (canceled cause of covid and got a full refund at the time). We kinda took a chance cause it seemed good. It was awesome. Location-wise, it is perfectly located a short walk from real Dahab and a short walk to the tourist center. The staff of the restaurant and accommodation were super friendly and helpful. The dive gear was perfect. The dive instructor and itinerary was perfect. Everything from being picked up and driven back to the airport worked like clockwork. Our free-lance dive guide, Youstina Youssef, was totally flexible, patient, professional and calm and collected. Halil and Lynne (owners) were super friendly and genuine. Wifi is limited in all of Dahab and so I recommend you buy a data sim at the airport. I think what I liked most about it is that it's unpretentious but totally comfortable and very well run. In the end it cost us less than we were quoted because we ended up doing a few less dives than we had booked (cause we needed to rest). And I was given the opportunity to settle my account when I received the final invoice after we had left.

It’s very chilled and friendly and hotels don’t come more friendly than Dive Urge. The staff are so welcoming and just can’t do enough to make your stay as comfortable as possible. My husband is coeliac so dining is a bit of an issue here but the chef made special food for him every day. Including gluten free donuts on his birthday!\nThe place has a very relaxed feel. It’s not a smart hotel, more like a guest house where you can kick off your shoes and walk around in your swimmies. Breakfast is on the beach with the waves lapping gently close by and a view of the beautiful sea and mountains. \nBeds are really comfortable and there is a fridge and water dispenser in your room. \nEveryone is welcome here-the last time we visited was with very young kids, now they are teenagers and there was lots to keep them happy. The house reef is a stunning snorkel. \nNow to the diving… the reefs are full of coral and fish. So many fish!  There are a load of dives sites, mostly shore dives, and they drive you to these up and down the coast. Some are really close by and others you might go to and stay out for the day, having lunch in one of the lovely local restaurants. Eating out here is very reasonable in price and delicious. There are safe places to leave all your kit and valuables and many sites have a shower as well as a toilet. \nYou set the pace. If you want to fit in lots of diving then you can. Or you can just do one or two each day… totally as you wish!\nOur dive guide was exceptional. She was ultra clear in her dive plans and explanations when training and guiding. Thorough and attentive, she helped the children and me with every dive. She gently encouraged my daughter to try some training dives and now she is an Advanced Open Water diver which was a real bonus!  There are snorkelling options for non-divers and the reefs are covered in life. We saw a turtle and octopus on the reef right in the middle of Dahab! You will not be disappointed!\n\nThe food at Dive Urge is great-Egyptian breakfast is a dinner winner with freshly made falafels, cheese and flat bread. The pancakes are also really special and come in beautifully shaped patterns-different every day!  Everything that comes out of the kitchen is delicious and beautifully presented. And all served with a big smile from the wonderful Attwah who will go to the ends of the earth to make your stay the best ever!\nWe hope to be back again very soon!","title":"Small and very friendly Hotel right on the beach.

stay at Dive Urge was incredible. We enjoyed a relaxing 6 days there, with 5 days of diving. The rooms are very comfortable, very clean, and quiet with excellent a/c and also screens on the windows and doors to catch the breeze. The garden was a terrific place to relax in after diving. Dive Urge has a small sandy beach right on a reef which offers excellent snorkeling.  Ahmed is the perfect host and super accommodating. \n\nThe dive center is highly professional. The equipment is top notch, and we felt very safe and in great hands with our dive master, Shereen. Hamid and Ben  could not have been more helpful or professional.  \n\nIf you are looking for a place to escape everyday life with some fantastic scenery and scuba diving, go to Dahab and stay at Dive Urge!","title":"Breathtaking scenery, excellent scuba diving","subratings":[],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false,"photos":[{"id":"596276086","locations":[{"name":"Dive Urge","id":"561592","web_url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297547-d561592-Reviews-Dive_Urge-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html","intent_url":"tripadvisor:///Hotel_Review-g297547-d561592-Reviews-Dive_Urge-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html","parent_location_id":297547}],"published_date":"2022-05-26T02:13:25-0400","user":{"username":"LoriRNYC","member_id":"0","user_id":"3D98BFC4FF4180737DC996D4460C69D2","type":"user","avatar":{"id":"41934297","caption":"LoriRNYC","published_date":"2012-06-02T14:47:20-0400","helpful_votes":"0","is_blessed":false,"uploaded_date":"2012-06-02T14:47:20-0400","images":{"small":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/02/7f/dd/d9/lorirnyc.jpg","width":"150","height":"150"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/02/7f/dd/d9/lorirnyc.jpg","width":"50","height":"50"},"large":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/7f/dd/d9/lorirnyc.jpg","width":"336","height":"450"},"medium":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/02/7f/dd/d9/lorirnyc.jpg","width":"153","height":"205"}}}},"helpful_votes":"0","is_blessed":false,"uploaded_date":"2022-05-26T02:13:25-0400","images":{"small":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/23/8a/73/76/caption.jpg","width":"150","height":"150"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/23/8a/73/76/caption.jpg","width":"50","height":"50"},"original":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/23/8a/73/76/caption.jpg","width":"1536","height":"2048"},"large":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/23/8a/73/76/caption.jpg","width":"338","height":"450"},"medium":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/23/8a/73/76/caption.jpg","width":"154","height":"205"}}}]},{"id":"830438332","lang":"en","location_id":"561592","published_date":"2022-03-07T15:34:55-05:00","published_platform":"Desktop","rating":"5","type":"review","helpful_votes":"0","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297547-d561592-r830438332-Dive_Urge-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review830438332","travel_date":"2022-02","text":"I returned for another stay with Dive Urge.

The rooms were very clean and the connecting beach is just perfect with it's sunbeds and view. They even arranged a taxi for me to get around, recommended a good kitesurfing instructor as well as arrange a private snorkelling tour for me at lighthouse beach at very short notice since I couldnt dive as I was flying the same day.

My visit was dominated by work as I had tons to do but it was fantastic working from any of the wonderful quiet spots at Dive Urge whether the garden,  restaurant, chill out area by beach or even on the beach! as the WiFi connection is excellent everywhere.  The best thing about Dive Urge is the family vibe. Lynn is a Brit and married to Muhammad an Egyptian and they have 3 beautiful children, Nadia, Hebba and Samur who are all 100% bilingual and very friendly and great sources for local info. Ahmed the Manager is a very sweet man and Nassimi who runs the restaurant is a gem. The room was really nicely furnished,  the fridge in it was much appreciated as were the tea and coffee making facilities.  I dived a few times with their Dive Instructor Ahmed who was very kind and I did my refresher with him and then did a few regular dives with him. Diving at Dive Urge is not cheap, but seeing as I went out alone with Ahmed I wasn't complaining. Dahab Divers is much cheaper at less than half the cost,  but then they have bigger groups of people too. I had breakfast included in my deal and it is to be recommended as you can choose what types of breakfast you want. I stayed over Xmas and we had a wonderful xmas dinner with all the staff and family.  My two weeks flew by and I was sad to leave everyone.

I particularly like this one. The hotel is located in the so-called \"villa district\", the construction of which was started only about 10 -12 years ago. The hotel is only a few years old and therefore still quite intact and beautiful. Laminate flooring, beautifully tiled bathroom, simple but tasteful furnishings. Thanks to soundproof windows and insulated walls, you can't hear the loud noise of the mosques in the morning or the very loud air conditioning in the courtyard. If you close the bedroom door at night, even the loud fridge is not disturbing. I slept like a log. The spring mattresses are very thick and new, maybe a little bit hard, but that is a matter of taste. The hotel manager Mahmud and his concierge Ibrahim are friendly and accommodating, but that goes without saying in Dahab. The location may seem a bit remote, but you can be on the beach promenade in 15 minutes and in Azahlah, the old town centre, in 7 minutes without much hurry.\nWhat I liked best: Here were no groups of men from Cairo partying noisily all night like in cheaper hotels.\n\nNot the hotel's fault, but a sincere warning: The way from the hotel to Lighthouse leads through streets whose pavements can become gravements. Everywhere there are up to 30 cm deep holes or manhole covers with handles sticking out 10 cm. In addition, these streets are very poorly lit.

a SSI/PADI DiveMaster and just spent 10 days at Shams. Dahab offers great dive sites, all accessible directly from the beach, which saves you a lot of boating time and inconvenience. On top it is a very nice -not too large and not to small- Arab town, with plenty choices of restaurants, bars, Bedouin type hang out places and cafes/bars and options to experience the Sinai dessert. Mozes picked up the 10 commands from mount Sinai which is a 1,5 hour trip and of course a magical place. If you go to Dahab, which I can highly recommend from many years and still expanding own experience, Shams is certainly a place to be. Well located, fair prices and in effect a well above average price/quality balance. It has a dive center as well, where the highest standards for divers and people who want to learn/experience diving are met. Daily dives are scheduled as well, with always a guide/instructor coming along. Last but not least, the Shams staff are really nice and pleasant people, without any exception. The only reason I give 5 stars is because there are not more ! Many thanks for having me again 10 days, keep on going Shams/everybody and I will be back for sure !!

group of seven family members settled into the Shams hotel in Dahab for several days of relaxation and diving.  We had a fabulous time.  The hotel is located at tone end of the main shopping/eating street, so it’s relatively quiet.  The rooms here are simple, comfortable and very clean.  There is plenty of hot water, and the beds are made up and clean towels provided every day.  The staff is amazing - Ashraf and his team are very warm and friendly and very attentive.  The restaurant is beautiful -situated right over the Gulf of Aquaba with a long bank of windows to enjoy the gorgeous view.  Food was great!  We enjoyed delicious and plentiful breakfasts each morning, with lots of choice (Egyptian breakfast/eggs/pancakes/fruit and yogurt….).  \nThe very friendly and relaxed dive master, Mohammed , runs the well equipped  dive shop.  We did multiple dives with him over several days.  He and his staff are well organized and very safety conscious..  I did notice that some of the dive equipment we rented was a little worn.  That said, our dive experience was excellent.  I especially recommend a dive at the “house reef” - you walk into the sea essentially from the restaurant.. it’s a beautiful dive!","title":"An excellent six day stay at the Shams Hotel and Dive

From the moment we crossed the border Ashraf was interested and asked and literally took care of all our needs.\n From taxis, arranging a snorkeling tour, without our asking, the man brought us falafel when we were hungry until the room and before we said goodbye, he even went and bought us drinks and snacks to have on the way back to the border.\n Personal attitude will be an understatement.  🥹\n\n Dahab is a wonderful and magical city, but our experience would not have been the same without the amazing hospitality of Ashraf and the entire hotel staff.","title":"Amazing

The hotel rooms are very cosy, spacious and clean. The hotel premises in general are very well looked after and always clean. The Liquid Adventures Dive center is within the hotel premises. It's one of the best organised dive centres we have visited. Each diver has their own hanger for suits and locker for diving gear. There are 2 big washing tanks for washing diving equipment after the dives. All of the premises are manned 24/7 and there are security cameras in common spaces which adds a level of security.\nThe hotel staff is just wonderful and always eager to help. \nThe Dive Center guides are great, with vast knowledge of the dive sites and very accommodating in diver's preferences.\nIf you are visiting Dahab look no further. This is the place to stay. If you are diving in Dahab then go with Liquid Adventures - you won't regret it.\nOverall 5 stars rating from us !!","title":"Amazing hotel with Dive Center in Dahab","owner_response":{"id":"876364843","lang":"en","published_date":"2023-01-25T20:31:03-05:00","connection":"Owner","responder":"Bassem Tamem","text":"Thank you George for your nice words and we hope to see you again one day soon :)","title":"Owner Response"},"subratings":[{"name":"Value","value":"5"},{"name":"Location","value":"5"},{"name":"Service","value":"5"}],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false},{"id":"874011201","lang":"en","location_id":"15815078","published_date":"2023-01-05T03:47:39-05:00","published_platform":"Mobile","rating":"5","type":"review","helpful_votes":"0","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297547-d15815078-r874011201-The_Bridge_Dahab-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review874011201","travel_date":"2022-12","text":"Fantastic small hotel hosted by the lovely Nadia and Baseem. It’s so well thought out and the rooms are stylish and spotless. Every room has a balcony and each room is large and comes with a kettle, tea and coffee. Lovely modern bathroom that is spotless. Cleaning is done on a request basis you just hang up your key in the morning on the cleaning request hooks. The cleaning is faultless. The breakfast is served outside on lovely rustic wooden tables and there is a selection of breakfast types you can choose all delicious including freshly made juice each morning. I don’t dive but the dive set up looks very well thought out and equipped. There is a weekly event timetable on the board by the office for the divers. Baseem and Nadia organised their driver for me to take me to meet my friend near 3 pools and organise the permission for the checkpoint amongst a few other local car journeys too I really appreciated this and felt safe being a solo female traveller. Baseem was contactable on WhatsApp so I never felt alone. The hotel is set back from the main boulevard and is like a little oasis in the area. I was there at Christmas and New Year which was a busy time for tourists but the hotel has a sense of calmness. Wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it’s the best in the area.","title":"Fantastic small hotel an oasis in

have spent 8 days in this small new 'boutique' hotel in Dahab, The Bridge Hotel and Liquid Adventures Dive Center, on a bed and breakfast basis. Owner Bassem, together with all employees, does everything to ensure that you have a real holiday feeling. Fantastic location in the center on the Boulevard so that all shops and restaurants are a short walk away. The location is such that you do not hear the crowds on the Boulevard. The rooms are spacious and clean, lovely bathroom and good bed. The house reef out front is one of the best in Dahab, we think, and for diving at other locations, transport is perfectly arranged and the guides listen to your diving wishes. They can also arrange your pick-up from the airport.\n\nThe rooms look great. Neatly finished, good bathroom, cleaning and fresh towels when you want. Hang your room key on the hook and your room will be cleaned when you are gone. The room has sufficient closet space and a fridge to keep your drinks cool. Next to the hotel is a small supermarket where you can buy soft drinks, chips, candy, etc., but there is also a small liquor store if you want alcoholic drinks.\n\nEvery day you can get clean bath towels, which you can use at the pool or take to the beach.\nThe breakfast was very good every morning, there were a number of dishes to choose from, but if you let the cook know what you would like, it will be made for you. A nice surprise was the smoothie of the day at breakfast :).\n\nThe diving facilities are superb. Enough and clean sinks, drying room and lockers to store your belongings. A nice instruction room for when you follow a course. The rental materials look great and are kept well organized. 12 and 15 liter bottles are more than sufficient and it is possible to dive with Nitrox.\n\nThere are many different dive sites in the area and the guides adapt to the wishes of the group. They have a lot of knowledge of the diving equipment and of the flora and fauna underwater. Besides good guides, they are also very nice people :-).\n\nThe atmosphere at The Bridge is friendly and familiar, the guest feels King here, everything is done to ensure that you have a great stay.\n\nCan I point out a side note or 'minus'...sincerely not.\n\nBassem and Nadia, thank you for the super fun days and your hospitality! I'll gladly come back again!","title":"Fantastic stay and top facilities for divers!","owner_response":{"id":"871553762","lang":"en","published_date":"2022-12-12T19:01:21-05:00","connection":"Owner","responder":"Bassem Tamem","text":"Thank you so much, my friend.

This place is incredible! I've stayed in a fair few hotels abroad but none that have such amazing staff. From the night security guy to the room cleaner, 10/10 all round. The owners Bassem and Nadia couldn't do enough to make our stay one of the best ever. Such genuine beautiful people who will go out of thier way to help you as much as they can.\n\nThe rooms are beautifully kept with all mod cons including fridges and safes (not that you need to use the safe) A choice of AC or ceiling fan and a spacious balcony to enjoy the evening before you head out to explore Dahab. Oh and of course the pool for an afternoon cool down dip!\n\nThe Bridge is located right in the centre of the strip with an amazing roof terrace to soak up the stunning views both day and night. Simply breathe taking! You are literally a 5 min walk in either direction to some amazing bars and restaurants and a 45 second walk to the sea for a spot of snorkeling. Couldn't be better situated.\n\nThe guys in the kitchen are absolute LEGENDS! All included breakfasts to die for and such amazing variety. I'm already missing my star shaped pancakes with lemon and powdered sugar!  \n\nThe hotel has its own dive school with all the trimmings! Some of the best instructors around and will make you feel at ease if you're a beginner, or take you out to do some super cool dives if you're an expert. Literally all bases covered. I've met some truly beautiful people that I'm hoping to stay in touch with for life. I can't wait to come and see you all again. You 100% made my holiday! \n\nIf you're looking to stay in Dahab (whether you dive or not) then I HIGHLY recommend The Bridge. You won't regret it. \n\n10/10 Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU.\n\nMerco x","title":"The BEST place to stay in Dahab....","owner_response":{"id":"866140943","lang":"en","published_date":"2022-10-27T02:49:02-04:00","connection":"Owner","responder":"Bassem Tamem","text":"Merco!

was my second stay at Red C Villas, this time with my teenage boys. Maggie and her staff are so lovely, welcoming and helpful. Rio and his family do everything they can to make you feel at home including helping with questions about the apartment and booking taxis etc. \nThe villas are comfortable and roomy - there were 3 of us in a 2 bedroom place on the ground floor and we had plenty of space. The kitchen was well equipped, there was always water to fill up bottles and the wifi was pretty reliable and strong.\nWe didn't use the pool but we did hang out on the rooftop terrace as the sun went down. Could maybe do with some more furniture there.\nWe enjoyed beautiful walks into town from the Villas - takes around 20 mins. \nAsala Square is not far for groceries and supplies.\nA taxi from town to the villas was 50 egyptian.\nWe had lovely walks up the mountains at the back of the villas to watch the sunsets. Absolutely stunning.\nI wouldn't hesistate to recommend Red C Villas to my friends.\nThank you Maggie and team for a wonderful stay - hope to see you soon, Inshallah","title":"I'll be back!","subratings":[{"name":"Value","value":"5"},{"name":"Location","value":"5"},{"name":"Service","value":"5"}],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false},{"id":"862374309","lang":"en","location_id":"4257292","published_date":"2022-09-28T13:34:05-04:00","published_platform":"Mobile","rating":"5","type":"review","helpful_votes":"0","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297547-d4257292-r862374309-Red_C_Villas-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review862374309","travel_date":"2022-09","text":"This is a villa complex, with four villas, two of which have been split into two apartments.  They have been built to a very high standard. The whole complex can sleep 28 people plus there’s a small studio on site for a further 2 guests. There’s a lovely pool in the centre of the villas with the apartments / villas facing into. Our villa also had a lovely roof terrace plus there’s a small patio outside of the main door, great for watching the early morning sunrise. We had two bedrooms in our 1st floor apartment; 1 with king sized bed and one other twin bedded room which we didn’t use. Plus two bathrooms, one of which was en-suite to the master bedroom.  There was a good shower, I found the bed comfy but my partner found it quite firm.  There is a kitchen / lounge / dining area with TV (although we didn’t use).  The kitchen is fairly well equipped but we didn’t dine in so didn’t attempt to cook as such but you could. There’s a decent sized fridge freezer plus a separate water cooler so you have everything you need. The villas do have Wi-Fi but it was patchy and sometimes not available so it’s advisable to buy a SIM for your phone. Rio and his family (who look after the villas for the owners) are on hand to help with any issues and he is very friendly. There’s also a communal washing machine which guests can use.  Although the villas are away from the centre of Dahab you can easily catch a taxi into town or better still hire a bike (as we did) and cycle in and out of town.  Although you do get a bit of road noise, once inside the gate, the villas provide a calming, relaxed place to stay with views of both sea and mountains. I’d  recommend earplugs as we found the air conditioner in the bedroom was a little noisy, plus it takes care of any background road noise. Overall we had a nice relaxing stay at the Villas and would definitely recommend.","title":"Lovely spacious air conditioned villa with beautiful pool","subratings":[],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false,"photos":[{"id":"640499033","locations":[{"name":"Red C Villas","id":"4257292","web_url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297547-d4257292-Reviews-Red_C_Villas-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html","intent_url":"tripadvisor:///Hotel_Review-g297547-d4257292-Reviews-Red_C_Villas-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html","parent_location_id":297547}],"published_date":"2022-09-28T17:34:04-0400","user":{"username":"ljosgood133","member_id":"0","user_id":"A37C6306C1E833AFB5672265B7047825","type":"user","avatar":{"id":"406324133","caption":"caption","published_date":"2019-07-07T10:01:15-0400","helpful_votes":"0","is_blessed":false,"uploaded_date":"2019-07-07T10:01:15-0400","images":{"small":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/18/38/03/a5/caption.jpg","width":"150","height":"150"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/18/38/03/a5/caption.jpg","width":"50","height":"50"},"original":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/18/38/03/a5/caption.jpg","width":"450","height":"450"},"large":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/18/38/03/a5/caption.jpg","width":"450","height":"450"},"medium":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/18/38/03/a5/caption.jpg","width":"205","height":"205"}}}},"helpful_votes":"0","is_blessed":false,"uploaded_date":"2022-09-28T17:34:04-0400","images":{"small":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/26/2d/3d/59/caption.jpg","width":"150","height":"150"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/26/2d/3d/59/caption.jpg","width":"50","height":"50"},"original":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/26/2d/3d/59/caption.jpg","width":"1536","height":"2048"},"large":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/26/2d/3d/59/caption.jpg","width":"338","height":"450"},"medium":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/26/2d/3d/59/caption.jpg","width":"154","height":"205"}}}]},{"id":"834065880","lang":"en","location_id":"4257292","published_date":"2022-04-10T10:46:34-04:00","published_platform":"Mobile","rating":"5","type":"review","helpful_votes":"0","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297547-d4257292-r834065880-Red_C_Villas-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review834065880","travel_date":"2022-04","text":"On arrival we were greeted and made to feel right at home, the flat was well maintained and well appointed, spacious and  comfortable The pool was refreshing.

The architectural elements and design create a beautiful, luxurious scene.  A few small touches such as a working TV and shampoo/conditioner with wash cloths included would push this place to excellent but in no way take away from the beauty.   The folks working here also demonstrate great hospitality and are very responsive which is appreciated.  One thing to note is those who are lighter sleepers and not early risers may want to reserve an apartment on the city side as there is fowl in the lot next door and the roosters crow quite loudly and early at dawn.  This is outside of the property, so hard to knock the place for this but it did cause me to wake earlier than desired each morning.

We exclusively hired it out. It is exactly like the pictures - simply heavenly with the views of the desert mountains and the sea, overlooking the courtyard pool. The rooms were big and spacious, each kitted out with a proper kitchen. Water coolers were provided. There is on-site laundry machines too. Pool was excellent, great rooftop terraces for some yoga practice. You can walk into town - it is not too far - otherwise plenty of taxis around. There is also a cute beach the opposite direction to town. You can also get a masseuse to come to the villa. The owners and cleaning staff were all lovely and helpful. Would definitely stay here if traveling in a group or you want to stay a bit away from the busier Dahab beach front - it really is easy and safe to get home from town.","title":"Exactly what you dreamed of","subratings":[{"name":"Value","value":"4"},{"name":"Location","value":"4"},{"name":"Service","value":"4"}],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false},{"id":"709813885","lang":"en","location_id":"4257292","published_date":"2019-09-14T23:09:57-04:00","published_platform":"Desktop","rating":"5","type":"review","helpful_votes":"0","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297547-d4257292-r709813885-Red_C_Villas-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review709813885","travel_date":"2019-09","text":"I just can’t get enough of this pool the new darker tiles are stunning at night along with the new LED light fittings making it a great place to relax and recharge we’ve had our laziest holiday ever spending hours beside the pool during the day and at night a massive thanks to Steve and Rio for making Red C Villas feel like home from home see you next year","title":"Relaxed at Red C Villas","subratings":[{"name":"Sleep Quality","value":"5"},{"name":"Location","value":"5"},{"name":"Service","value":"5"}],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false},{"id":"695757881","lang":"en","location_id":"4257292","published_date":"2019-08-05T06:16:29-04:00","published_platform":"Desktop","rating":"5","type":"review","helpful_votes":"1","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297547-d4257292-r695757881-Red_C_Villas-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review695757881","travel_date":"2019-07","text":"We stayed at Red C Villas for 10 days during a diving trip to Dahab and absolutely loved it\n\nI cannot recommend the Red C as an accommodation venue enough.

During the day, Rio, the onsite manager was there to help whenever we had a query. \n\nThe accommodation itself is simply stunning.

The property and apartments are immaculate, pristine, and modern with everything one might need for a long or short term stay.  We were upgraded to the two bedroom apartment and it was the perfect way to conclude our honeymoon.  We had intended to stay for 3 nights but our time in Dahab was so perfect we extended for 6 nights.  The sauna was welcomed on the chilly nights after swimming in the sea. The beds are super comfortable, the kitchen is stocked with everything you need to cook meals, the shower was piping hot, and though we didn't use it they were equipped with a/c and heat and television with cable.  The wifi was often spotty but that seems to be the norm in all of Egypt and didn't dampen our experience.  Steven and Rio took exceptional care of us and it was bittersweet to say goodbye.

The hotel setting and the hotel is beautiful. A fab place to relax with a homey feel. \nRooms are very comfortable if not smart and as each one has the perfect view it’s an oasis.

We walked past several other hotels and thought that Swiss Inn had the most beautiful beach. \nWe went end of February and the weather was hot - the wind made things more tolerable and was great for trying out windsurfing. \nPool was not heated at the start of the stay but we were told that there was a fuel shortage - by the end of our stay the pool was a lovely temperature. But we spent most of the time in the sea. \nHotel taxi to town cost us 60 EGP (4 people) and we had to find a taxi back. There is a coastal path which takes maybe 30-45 mins - a tad too long for little legs. \n\nStaff are very friendly, very attentive and gave the kids lots of attention. \nKids loved Miss Samar in kids club and wanted to go every day. Lovely little kids club with play park. \nStayed in a family room which comes with a massive double bed and a small double sofa bed. Plenty of space for a family of 4. \n\nThis is definitely not your “Brits-abroad” holiday - very multi-national. We went half-board and found the food great, not repetitive. Every evening had a different theme, and was reflective of the variety of nationalities at the hotel. No chips etc, but they would make pasta if the kids were being fussy. Plenty of vegetarian food. I’m vegan and got by, although food not labelled with allergens. No dairy-free milk for morning coffee though! Loved Friday’s Egyptian food. \n\nMy only two small criticisms:\n1 - reception staff not as helpful as the rest of the hotel staff. Took three trips to reception to get our door lock fixed, didn’t help with a booking issue prior to our stay, and due to struggling to get change we found ourselves stuck at the hotel with no help for a solution from reception. But we happened to come across Karin who I think is guest relations and she is brilliant and has all the answers. MONEY TIP - the money exchange machine in the hotel does not accept GBP notes even though it is supposed to, it only takes EUR and USD notes. But the shuttle can take you to a nearby bank where the machine works. Also NO-ONE has change - not the hotel shuttle, hotel shop, taxis, shops in Dahab etc. So we couldn’t get a taxi or buy anything until we met Karin who changed some of our big notes within minutes. \n2 - the hotel is dead in the evening! No atmosphere at all. We didn’t want/expect entertainment and knew it would be quiet, but there is no music. Restaurant is a bit dull, and they haven’t made the most of the beach bar. The beach bar needs a bit better lighting and louder music playing Egyptian music, not quietly playing Meatloaf and Bonnie Tyler. Then people may want to chill and buy drinks rather than go to their rooms at 8pm . \n\nOverall great holiday which we recommend. We and the kids loved it and only wished we booked longer!","title":"Great for families","owner_response":{"id":"881070607","lang":"en","published_date":"2023-03-05T07:14:31-05:00","connection":"Guest Services / Front Office","responder":"Guest  Relation Team","text":"Dear mrandmrsmash.

You can help yourself to soft drinks, tallying them on a whiteboard so you can pay on checkout. Beach towels are freely available to borrow, and the wi-fi is superb!\nThe owner leaves you to freely enjoy the hotel so you feel really at home.

The shared spaces make for a communal feel and meeting the other guests was very seamless.  The room itself is wonderful- good space, nice clean bathroom.  \n\nKhaled totally saved me a few days before check out.  I had come down with severe food poisoning and was planning to just wait it out.  He recommended a trip to the doctor's and I'm glad I took his advice.  The food poisoning was accompanied by a 39C fever and the local doctor prescribed a few things that took away the agony that same evening.  I was good to go the next day before my long flight home.  Khaled also arranged the taxi to the doctor's, in addition to the follow up visit (the driver stayed with me, so I didn't have to worry about the ride back to the Coachhouse).  Khaled even handled a transaction with a restaurant I had booked with the night I got sick- he made sure the money I owed the restaurant was properly transferred to them.","title":"Saved me during the last few days!","owner_response":{"id":"636613104","lang":"en","published_date":"2018-11-29T21:23:43-05:00","connection":"Owner","responder":"dahabcoachhouse","text":"Thanks for your kind review.

I must have tried most rooms there now, all very nice, comfortable and with different décor.  I especially like that it is small place with only eight rooms. The housekeeper does a very good job keeping the rooms and surrounding areas clean, and the staff is very helpful and friendly.  I enjoyed spending time in the beautiful courtyard or garden with all its plants. The place is very quiet even if it is just a around the corner from the beach promenade and everything you need.  I don’t mind not being served breakfast as the famous German Bakery is just 2 minutes walk away, or I will prepare myself some breakfast in the well-equipped  and spotlessly clean kitchen.

There's also a clean, private beach of sorts just outside the hotel.\n\nThe rooms are in keeping with the prices charged. Nothing too fancy, but clean and comfortable. The inclusive breakfast is at the Steakout restaurant. It is a set menu, but the staff were more than willing to tweak it to my taste. It still didn't compare to a full buffet breakfast, but I always managed to eat my fill.\n\nThe front desk staff, Ahmed and Dina are a delight.

Supermarket for water, etc is right outside the hotell. \nThe rooms are simple and not high quality, but its also one of the cheapest hotels in Dahab, so you get what you pay for. We got new towels whenever we wanted and they cleaned the room on request. Aircondition and wifi in the room. \nThe backyard is very cozy, we hung out in the lounge both for breaktfast and in the evening. The staff and the owner, Soliman, was very helpfull and always friendly. We had a late flight back home the day we checked out, and he offered us to keep the room the whole day without paying more. The also helped us book our Sinai-trip with Jimmy from the hotel just up the street. \nIf your fine with living in a simple room and dont want to pay extra for luxury, this is a great place to stay, felt like home!","title":"Great place, friendly staff, you get what you pay for","owner_response":{"id":"727712940","lang":"en","published_date":"2019-11-20T01:31:00-05:00","connection":"Owner","responder":"Mohamedsoli","text":"Thank you Giske for taking time to write your review.We are pleased you had a great time and felt like home in Jowhara Hotel. \nWe hope to see you again.","title":"Owner Response"},"subratings":[{"name":"Location","value":"4"},{"name":"Cleanliness","value":"5"},{"name":"Service","value":"5"}],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false},{"id":"726705158","lang":"en","location_id":"1541813","published_date":"2019-11-15T18:56:51-05:00","published_platform":"Mobile","rating":"5","type":"review","helpful_votes":"0","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297547-d1541813-r726705158-Jowhara_Hotel-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review726705158","travel_date":"2019-11","text":"I had a great stay at Jowhara.

INMO's location between the lively Mashraa street and the sea promenade means a great access to dozens of grocery stores, cafés and restaurants, pharmacies, bike rental shops and bakeries. It takes ca 5-7 minutes to walk to the GoBus, BlueBus and WeBus bus station, or 15 min to the East Delta bus station (regular bus services to (Sharm el Sheikh). \n\nThe atmosphere at INMO is what one needs to relax and rest... and the big size of the complex offers a great choice: either relax by the pool or go onto a nice wooden structure with many comfy chairs and sunbeds. Breakfast is always included and served by the pool by the amazing Rafat, with delicious Egyptian omelette, coffee, fruits and yummy local treats.  You cal always get tasty lunch and dinner at INMO's restaurant. \n\nThe rooms are fantastically comfortable and cosy. The wooden interior design creates a great, natural and relaxing atmosphere. There is a wide variety of rooms with different amenities, so make sure to look into what you book. The rooms are cleaned every single day and the bed sheets are changed regularly, you don't even need to as for it. The cleaning is very thorough and the hygiene standards are high! \n\nOverall, highly recommended! The owners and their family are phenomenal people, too. Always caring and ready to help. AND be ready to meet many gorgeous cats!

Just outside the lodge there is everything: markets, bakery, bicycle rental, food.\nMy room was spacious. Yes, it could use some maintenance on some details, but everything worked. It even has air conditioning, a small balcony, a refrigerator and a closet. The room rate was very affordable and it included breakfast and my very own room cat. This sweet cat was dedicated to keeping me company.\nThe restaurant has one of the nicest terraces on the strip. The atmosphere is really chill, with lots of friendly cats, a couple of sweet dogs, beautiful colours, breeze. And of course the food! Everything I had was very good, and the portions are generous (as I found them to be also in other bedouin establishments). But the best part of the Bedouin Lodge are the people, from the reception, to the restaurant, to the owner, to the dive center. Everyone was so nice and accommodating.

perfect hotel if you're looking for the true Dahab experience and want value for money. We stayed for one week and loved it. The highlights are the service, which is incredible, and the restaurant sitting area, which is beautifully decorated in the traditional Bedouin style and is the perfect place to chill out after a day of diving. The location is ideal too, a 5-minute walk to the town centre but very quiet and relaxing and right by the beach. The people are extremely friendly and everyone went out of their way to make our stay as good as possible, arranging a taxi to and from the airport, letting us check in at night, and planning day trips to tourist sites. We always felt extremely welcome and cared for.\n\nAs for the accommodation, we stayed in a double room on the second floor with a balcony and a beautiful Arabic domed ceiling. The room was the perfect size for us, and we loved having the balcony to sit and read in the evenings. If you're looking for a spotlessly clean room then this place probably isn't for you (you might struggle to find that in Dahab anyway), but we didn't mind it so much. After all, with free breakfasts and amazing personal service it's great value for money!\n\nWe especially recommend this hotel to anyone going to Dahab for diving. There’s an amazing dive centre (Bedouin Divers Dahab) at the same location, which was so convenient. There’s even a great diving spot right in front of the hotel: we just walked straight into the ocean in our gear!","title":"Amazing service and great

bedouin lodge was recommended by some friends of mine. As it should be! First of all the vibe is very relaxed. As soon as you arrive you experience the Egyptian hospitality. You easily feel part of the community because of all the good people there! I went there to learn how to dive at the bedouin divers. If you’re lucky you have Ahmed to teach you. Great teacher, he always reflects calmness and peace of mind, I always felt safe underwater. But it’s as good as a place for non-divers too. Close to the sea, Dahab center, bike rental, shops and the lagoon. \n\nPricing is also very good (I’m a backpacker on a budget) but that doesn’t really matter, what matters is that after staying in the bedouin lodge you can call this place a home away from home. Last of all whenever you don’t feel like going out to eat you’re in luck because the food at the bedouin lodge is very good. The Egyptian breakfast is definitely the way to go!","title":"Home away from home","owner_response":{"id":"826329691","lang":"en","published_date":"2022-01-30T09:54:46-05:00","connection":"Guest Services / Front Office","responder":"Mai-Kee  To","text":"Hey Mauritzt, we really enjoy reading your review - and we even enjoyed more, having you here as our guest.

And Bedouin Lodge is the best place to stay! I have met some incredible people and 3 weeks flew by in a heartbeat.\n\nA hidden gem just a short walk away from the hustle and bustle of the town center, offering the most beautiful beach and full moon views whilst relaxing in their outdoor lounge. This place felt like home in a heartbeat, whether that's because of its outstanding food (Saad, best chef in town - hands down!) or the warm welcoming atmosphere and all day smiles from Abu Shadi. \n\nThe rooms are basic but nice and clean so def great value for money. And if there is something missing or you want to book a trip other than diving, Mohammed and Osama will go far and beyond to make it happen. From laundry service to horse back riding, Bedouin nights in the mountains, hiking St. Catherine - nothing that can't be organized.\n\nAnd then last but not least, if you are a passionate diver - jackpot! The inhouse dive center is run by one of the best and most passionate as well as professional divers I have ever met, taking you to some of the most beautiful dive sites Sinai has to offer.\n\nAs you can imagine - I left the Lodge heavy hearted but my next trip is already in the making!!","title":"Best stay in Dahab that was hard to

Room attended when required. The hotel pooli is ideal size - for just dips or doing laps for fitness. The hotel food is great and very flexible to meet your food requirements. By no means least I should praise the great staff, always helpful and friendly and willing to help and advise any request.\n I was combining a holiday with post operation re hab after knee surgery with an extended stay over a number of weeks- the price reducing the longer the stay - just call the manager to discuss this as you plan your holiday and budget. Everything you need for your holiday is close by. So please support the local people and choose Christina hotel with confidence.","title":"Great Hotel with great staff","subratings":[{"name":"Value","value":"5"},{"name":"Location","value":"5"},{"name":"Service","value":"5"}],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false},{"id":"185146864","lang":"en","location_id":"1483084","published_date":"2013-11-18T19:03:31-05:00","published_platform":"Desktop","rating":"4","type":"review","helpful_votes":"0","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297547-d1483084-r185146864-Christina_Residence_Hotel-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review185146864","travel_date":"2012-12","text":"We always stay at Christina Residence when in Dahab.

My review is for the Pool rooms only. Based on the website, these rooms are all different with different fee structures. Christina Pool is right in the middle. I would definitely call this a budget price but not a budget feel. I'm a foreigner (American teacher in Cairo) but I reside in Egypt, so I inquired about a different rate and I got it!  Yay for me! The room is quite large for a single, though my bed is a double. The bathroom is also large with a nice sized vanity area. There is adequate room for clothes, and all your personal belongings. Oh and there are lots of outlets to charge up all your electronic gear and gizmos. The room does not have a tv, but do you really need one?  But there is a small fridge for soda, juices, yogurt, etc. And the wifi in the room is free and fast! It always amazes me how upscale, luxury hotels always charge for wifi. My room had a pool view, and is on the first floor (I'm used to thinking second floor).  There is a breakfast buffet included...it's simple, but I don't need a big breakfast: rolls, croissants, fresh fruit salad, eggs, and a few other dishes. There was also fresh, cold karkada (hibiscus tea)...it's sweet, and cold and yummy. Since this is budget, please note to bring your own shower necessities. A small soap and shampoo packets were provided. If you don't bring any, no worries, there are enough pharmacies and markets to get what you need, just steps out of the hotel. Also, no hairdryer in room. While there is a safe in the room, it's not large enough to stash electronics.  There was also no hot water kettle or a few packets of tea or Nescafe. This isn't a huge deal breaker though. The bed and bedding might be the ONLY negative. But it wasn't a bother to me, I just thought I'd better share this. The bed is firm, again, not a problem for me. The sheets, while clean, were a little rough, though the pillow cases felt nice and cool. Speaking of cool, the room has a/c which is a BIG PLUS!  Some type of mattress pad between sheet and mattress would have been nice, but still not a big problem. I just thought it would be best to post the particulars. \nThe location is excellent. If you leave the grounds by the pool area, this will take you to the beach and along the Corniche which has countless shops and restaurants. If you leave by the lobby, this is really the village side parallel to the Corniche. This side will also take you to the souk/marketplace and loops right back to the sea side. It's lively and colorful and yes, the business owners want your money. Tourism is down. Just be polite, say \"no thank you,\" or \"later\" and walk on. They do take it quite well...but they will also remember you!\nThe staff at the Christina are warm, and helpful as well without being ingratiating. \nDahab is my favorite place in Egypt. I've been to two hotels in Dahab and the Christina is by far my favorite of the two.","title":"Budget Price, but VERY

It is in the middle of everything in Dahab. There are grocery stores, restaurants, shops all around the hotels but yet it is quiet inside the hotel. The exterior of the hotel has a theme of a ship with a sailing mast. The view from the hotel top floor is breathtaking. You can see the entire bay of Dahab from the roof top. There is a sitting area in the very front of the 2nd floor overlooking the street and the bay. It has some soft and conformable chairs and sofas to enjoy the view.\n\nThis hotels is a small boutique hotel with less than 15 rooms so each guest gets a very focused attention from the staff. The rooms are not that small. It is adequate for 2 people and is clean. The beds are comfortable and the beddings are clean. Each room has air-conditioning, closet, refrigerator and a TV. The windows are not properly seals but that is not a big issue because it hardy ever rains in Dahab. They are currently renovating the hotel and is currently expanding to a slightly bigger hotel. They are adding a new swimming pool in the back plus if not mistaken about 10-12 more rooms. \n\nThe hotel staff is one of the best I have seen in a long time. They are absolutely super friendly and super super nice. Being a small hotel if you ask anything to one of the staff members then everyone knows about it and therefore things are done a lot faster. The hotel employees will go beyond the normal steps to ensure that every guests are happy and satisfied. During our stay we were dealing with Sahab, he has an excellent attitude of hospitality and customer service. His vision and expertise of helping the customers is a very important and valuable asset for the hotel. \n\nThe restaurant is located just in-front of the hotel across the street over looking the bay. Every day there are various breakfast options which are all very delicious and healthy. The sitting area is just over the water so you can see the water below. \n\nI would say this this is an excellent hotel in my opinion but one advise to every one is that Dahab by its nature is neither similar to Sharm el Sheikh nor to Hurghada or Cairo. So the level of quality of the hotels cannot be justified by comparing with the ones in other larger cities. Dahab is a very laid back mellow village and so are its inhabitants. You can not expect the same level of a 5 star hotel in Dahab compared to other modern cities. \n\nOver all the hotel is absolutely fantastic, when the renovation and expansion is fisnihed I believe it will be one of the best hotels in the city center. Most importantly the employees are the best and so I give this hotel a 5 star review.","title":"Absolutely Fantastic Location and Extremely Friendly Hotel Staff","subratings":[{"name":"Location","value":"5"},{"name":"Cleanliness","value":"5"},{"name":"Service","value":"5"}],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false},{"id":"819922546","lang":"en","location_id":"21205719","published_date":"2021-11-24T09:26:19-05:00","published_platform":"Desktop","rating":"5","type":"review","helpful_votes":"0","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297547-d21205719-r819922546-Downtown_Dahab-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review819922546","travel_date":"2021-11","text":"We really enjoyed our stay at Downtown, the place was in the middle of the turistic walkway, surrounded by restaurants, cafes, and souvenir shops.

We will definitely come back one day.\n\nThe communication with Rochelle beforehand in the booking proces was smooth, and the caretaker, Amr, is always helpful and available, either in person or by Whatsapp.\n\nRed Rock Apartments is located a 20 minute walk from the town center. We rented bikes there, so we could get around quicker with ease. A lot of people use bikes in Dahab, and you can make the trip from the southern part (Laguna Beach) to the north (Red Rock Apartments) in about half an hour.\n\nThere are four apartments, so a lot of the time you have the whole place for yourself. The pool is huge, our apartment had e v e r y t h i n g we needed, and it is also suited for longer stays. Cooking facilities, a huge fridge, a freezer, microwave, an oven, a washing machine, dishwasher, even a Nespresso machine. The interior decor is also very, very tasteful. \n\nThe roof terrace is a bliss. There's a jacuzzi and plenty of opportunities to enjoy a 360 view of the surroundings. We loved kicking back during the evening listening to the sounds of the city. People walking by on the street below laughing or arguing, a barking dog, a waiter dropping a plate, the nearby ocean - the atmosphere here has middle east written all over it, since Red Rock Apartments isn't situated in the more touristy part of Dahab. So you feel you live amongst the locals.\n\nThere are plenty of local restaurants and small supermarkets nearby. The well reviewed Ralphs' German Bakery is also close by, if you opt for a more traditional western breakfast.","title":"An oasis within an

about this place was perfect - starting from the communication with Rochelle, the trip management, the place itself. Its very peaceful, the street is well lit at night, so it looks charming both during the night as well as the day. Apartment is equipped with everything one may need, but even if any extras come to mind or unexpected situations appear, manager Amr is there for it all. There was a welcome kit which helped a lot as the transfer times were crazy late. Views from the roof are mind boggling. Our stay in this lovely place made the whole experience very special, we came for the family get together, and we had the best time. A true gem in Dahabs diverse but yet very specific apartments offer.

The owner and host, Thomas, is extremely friendly – he makes his guests feel like they are being welcomed into his home. He served us fresh orange juice on arrival, cooked up dinner and shared many drinks with us on New Years’ Eve, helped us schedule transportation from the hotel, and was able to collect our laundry when we were away from the property. That said, the hotel leaves a lot to be desired. It is seemingly a passion project built by the owner and is run more like a guesthouse than a hotel. For instance, the design is unique and incohesive, though it may appeal to others. There is no formal reception, we just interacted with Thomas via Whatsapp prior to arrival. The hotel is tucked away from the main strip of Dahab and there is no road leading to the property, which made it confusing for our taxi driver to find. Because it is situated a ways from the main road, there isn’t much of a view from the hotel, just desert and construction sites. Finally, we had some issues with the room itself such as dusty floors on arrival and no hot water for 3 days. Overall, the host made our stay very enjoyable by making the experience personal instead of purely transactional but without Thomas, I don’t think we would recommend the place.","title":"Unmatched hospitality but has issues","subratings":[{"name":"Value","value":"4"},{"name":"Sleep Quality","value":"4"},{"name":"Service","value":"5"}],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false},{"id":"824069700","lang":"en","location_id":"19723307","published_date":"2022-01-05T12:17:08-05:00","published_platform":"Mobile","rating":"5","type":"review","helpful_votes":"0","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297547-d19723307-r824069700-Casa_D_Or_Dahab-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review824069700","travel_date":"2021-12","text":"We loooved staying at Casa d’Or.

I must say that this is one of the best boutique hotel experiences I’ve had hands-down. The owner was absolutely incredible. I felt like I was staying at a A world famous Hotel. Every single thing that we wanted was organized and there was just nothing that  the Casa D’OR team would not do for us. I loved the bedrooms they were spacious and modern. Exterior was great too, we spent many days by the swimming pool bathing in the warm Egyptian sun. The breakfast was crazy. Every morning the owner and his team would rustle up a delicious homemade breakfast.\nWhen it comes to diving this is the spot. Thomas (the owner) took us out two to three times a day, held our hands all the way. I don’t think you could ever have a better dive master than Thomas. We felt so safe deep under and had the best time of our life.\n I am now proud to say I have my Open Water license. It’s just crazy out there. You stick your head under the water with a mask and it feels like you’ve suddenly arrived in paradise.\nSo to conclude an excellent hotel with superb service and one of the best hosts I’ve experienced. Diving I believe speaks for itself in Dahab!

Bereits bei der Buchung konnten wir individuelle Wünsche für unseren Aufenthalt äußern. Um diese zu erfüllen, setzte Thomas erfolgreich alle verfügbaren Hebel für uns in Bewegung und führte uns sicher zu den besten Unterwasser Hotspots im Roten Meer. Durch seine professionelle Ausbildung und jahrelange Erfahrung war jeder Tauchgang, ob von Land oder vom Privatboot ein großes Vergnügen :) \n\nDas Hotel wurde erst dieses Jahr nach den Wünschen von Mélanie und Thomas erbaut und ist daher super modern und hat eine tolle persönliche Note. Unser Zimmer war sehr sauber und wurde jeden Tag vom Staff aufgeräumt und gereinigt. Ob am Pool, auf der Dachterasse oder in der offenen Küche, überall kann man gemütlich zusammensitzen und bis tief in die Nacht Spiele spielen und Mélanies Drinks genießen.\nDas Frühstück ist wie bei einer großen Familie: Man steht auf wenn man zum Tauchen los will oder wann man eben einfach wach ist und bekommt super leckeren Kaffee. Wenn alle da sind, serviert Mélanie mit ihrem Team das vielfältige Frühstück, bei dem man sich perfekt für lange Tauchtage stärken kann.\n\nTrotz der familiären Atmosphäre kommt die Privatsphäre nicht zu kurz. Man kann sich auch Essen aufs Zimmer liefern lassen und den Abend vor dem Netflix-fähigen Fernseher ausklingen lassen. Zum Ausgehen, ob zusammen oder alleine haben Thomas und Mélanie immer eine guten Tipp und bestellen auch gerne ein Taxi, falls nötig.\n\nDanke für die tolle Zeit! Für uns seid ihr mehr als die Eigentümer des Hotels in Dahab in dem wir unseren Urlaub 2019 verbracht haben!","title":"Der Name ist Programm!","subratings":[{"name":"Sleep Quality","value":"5"},{"name":"Cleanliness","value":"5"},{"name":"Service","value":"5"}],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false},{"id":"734704015","lang":"de","location_id":"19723307","published_date":"2019-12-26T03:11:29-05:00","published_platform":"Desktop","rating":"5","type":"review","helpful_votes":"0","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297547-d19723307-r734704015-Casa_D_Or_Dahab-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review734704015","travel_date":"2019-12","text":"Im Casa D'or fühlt man sich gleich wohl. Auch wenn man mitten in der Nacht ankommt, wird man von den Gastgebern Mélanie und Thomas herzlich empfangen. Da das Casa nur 8 Zimmer hat, besteht eine familiäre Athmosphäre. So wird individuell auf die Wünsche der Gäste eingegangen und die Mitarbeitenden sind bei diversen Belangen hilflich. Die geschmackvoll eingerichteten Zimmer werden täglich gereinigt und die Minibar mit den gewünschten Getränken aufgefüllt.\n\nDas Casa D’or liegt etwas abseits des Zentrums, wodurch es auch für Ruhesuchende geeignet ist. Denoch ist man in ca. 5 Minuten zu Fuss am der Strandpromenade mit zahlreichen Shops und Restaurants.\n\nEs gibt keine fixen Frühstückzeiten, das leckere Frühstück wird nach vorabendlicher Absprache serviert oder einfach wenn du aufstehst, auch wenn es bereits Nachmittag ist. Zum Nachtessen sind wir entweder mit Mélanie und Thomas in eines der Restaurants an der Strandpromenade gegangen oder haben Essen ins Casa bestellt. Dabei konnten wir von den Empfehlungen unserer Gastgeber profitieren und haben immer gut gegessen.\n\nDas Tauchen läuft auch sehr flexibel und unkompliziert ab. Wir haben jeweils am Vortag mit Thomas besprochen wer wann wo tauchen geht und er hat alles organiasiert. Ein Taxi holte uns zur vereinbarten Zeit ab, dann wurden die Tanks an einer Tauchbasis geholt und ab gings zum Tauchplatz. Nach dem Tauchen wurde unser Equipmen vom Staff im Casa D’or gereinigt und dort zum trocknen gelagert. Zum Service gehört auch eine komplette Reinigung des Equipment vor der Heimreise, so dass die Sachen zuhause einfach wieder verstaut werden können.\n\nIch kann das Casa D’or wärmstens weiterempfehlen. Mélanie und Thomas machen den Urlaub mit ihrer herzlichen humorvollen Art zu einem echten Erlebnis. Auch Taucheinsteiger sind hier gut aufgehoben. Als leidenschaftlicher Taucher und erfahrener Instruktor führt Thomas die Tauchkurse mit viel Herzblut durch. Wir haben im Casa D’or ein zweites Zuhause gefunden und kommen auf jeden Fall wieder 😊","title":"Klein aber oho - in den Ferien zuhause","subratings":[{"name":"Rooms","value":"5"},{"name":"Service","value":"5"}],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false}],"location":{"coordinates":["28.492746","34.51223"],"address":"Peace Rd.

We did yoga by seaside. \nThank you,Canyon Estate. \nWe will come back for sure! 10/10!\n","title":"It’s like our new home ;)","subratings":[],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false},{"id":"781964893","lang":"en","location_id":"2708221","published_date":"2021-01-29T05:28:43-05:00","published_platform":"Desktop","rating":"5","type":"review","helpful_votes":"0","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297547-d2708221-r781964893-Canyon_Estate_Dahab_Beach_Hotel_Residence-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review781964893","travel_date":"2021-01","text":"When we arrived we were very impressed of this awesome place, we didnt set out expectations high, as its a natural place, but if you want just run away and found a quite place you are here one the right place.

The place it self is done with lots of love to details, just a place to take energy and relax.the food in the restaurant is also very tasty. We enoyed it so much.

The customer service is poor at best. The manager Bota doesn't make you feel welcome, in fact he treated us like.second class citizens. The pool was.nice until.it started looking dirty. Another customer asked them to clean it which they did not and by the time we left the pool had turned green in colour. Disgusting. The rooms are getting run down and they supply you with limited linen and towels. They want 8 euros each time to change the sheets or clean the room. They even had a problem with us hanging our clothes to dry on our own lines. On top of all that they charge you extra for electricity . That in itself is not a problem, except they charge nearly quadruple the normal.rate. When we approached the manager ( Bota ) about this he informed me that if you don't like it , we can leave. All in all it has the potential to be a nice place, but for that to happen they will need to refurbish the room increase levels of customer service dramatically , and just be genuinely more nice and approachable.

was great:\n- The location is good; quiet and next to the Delta Bus Company Stop that can take you to Sharm.\n- in a couple of minutes away you can reach the main street in Dahab with plenty of shops, cafés, restaurants\n- In front of the Hotel there is a bike rental store\n- The breakfast was big enough and delicious, and every day was slightly different\n- The staff is super nice and they are there for you if you need something (Mohammed is a super good guy and helpful)\n- The swimming pool is a plus and it is cleaned every morning\n- I would indeed go back there in case I am in Dahab\n- I felt really at ease at the hotel\n- It is very safe down there”\n\nWell done guys, keep it on :)","title":"Excellente accommodation (cosy, helpful staff and good

hotel staff are very friendly and flexible. We actually had to adjust our stay more than once and they were very flexible and understanding. The rooms are clean and practical. The ACs are excellent. The pool was great and they clean it twice a day. We had unlimited access to wifi, huge smart tv, and huge bluetooth speakers. We enjoyed several movie nights and pool parties! It’s located in the heart of Dahab, just a walking distance from Dahab’s main street and everything we need. Also just a 2 minutes walk to the sea. 30 minutes walk to the Lagoona, which is the best beach in Dahab in my opinion. It’s also a 5 minutes walk from the bus station.

of dahab \n\nI stayed here for 3 nights as I was diving with The Big Blue who are based on the same site as the hotel, which made everything very convenient. \n\nWhen I arrived I had a lovely welcome from the staff and was offered a refreshing welcome lemon drink sitting in their beach cafe\n\nMy room was typical Egyptian style and was very clean.  I asked for an additional sheet which came quickly and if I wanted the room cleaned daily. The shower pressure was fine for washing but not powerful enough to wash my hair. (However I used a complimentary room at the end of the day and the shower pressure was great so may have just been my room) I used a jug which was fine with me to wash my hair. I had a lovely balcony which directly faced the sea with a table and chairs to sit at. \n\nThe hotel is literally on the sea front - 20 metres from my room. \nThey have a Bedouin style cafe/ lounge area where you can have you breakfast looking out onto the sea. \n\nA simple breakfast is served between 8 and 10am. Omelette, a few\nslices of fruit, natural yogurt, toast with jam and honey and a good cup of tea. A big thanks so to Sayed for making me a cup of tea each morning.There is also a comprehensive menu of traditional and European food - I recommend the falafel sandwich. \n\nA lovely lady called Ashaan was very kind with a beautiful smile. She cleaned my room and refilled any bits I needed. \n\nShe made the most wonderful Mashi (stuff vine leaves) and shared them with me. They were absolutely delicious. You must try them. \n\nThe hotel is a ten minute stroll from the centre of dahab which I loved. You then have the choice to have a busy evening (not that anywhere in dahab is busy). I chose to sit at night on a sunbed outside the hotel cafe listening to the waves with Egyptian music playing in the background reading my book. I couldn’t think of any better way to relax.  I think the distance from the town adds to the charm of the hotel. There is a street at the top of the road where you can eat at different cafes and there is very small supermarket.\n\nI would definitely recommend The Star of Dahab - it gets a thumbs up from me 👍👍👍🤗","title":"Perfect","subratings":[],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false,"photos":[{"id":"425067762","locations":[{"name":"Star Of Dahab","id":"1762414","web_url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297547-d1762414-Reviews-Star_Of_Dahab-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html","intent_url":"tripadvisor:///Hotel_Review-g297547-d1762414-Reviews-Star_Of_Dahab-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html","parent_location_id":297547}],"published_date":"2019-09-21T08:36:05-0400","user":{"username":"960kerryg","member_id":"0","user_id":"8D7FAF2803AC514FE42E1F0084833DC0","type":"user","avatar":{"id":"425088639","caption":"Kerry G","published_date":"2019-09-21T10:38:30-0400","helpful_votes":"0","is_blessed":false,"uploaded_date":"2019-09-21T10:38:30-0400","images":{"small":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/19/56/56/7f/kerry-g.jpg","width":"150","height":"150"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/19/56/56/7f/kerry-g.jpg","width":"50","height":"50"},"original":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/19/56/56/7f/kerry-g.jpg","width":"782","height":"782"},"large":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/19/56/56/7f/kerry-g.jpg","width":"450","height":"450"},"medium":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/19/56/56/7f/kerry-g.jpg","width":"205","height":"205"}}}},"helpful_votes":"0","is_blessed":false,"uploaded_date":"2019-09-21T08:36:05-0400","images":{"small":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/19/56/04/f2/star-of-dahab-hotel.jpg","width":"150","height":"150"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/19/56/04/f2/star-of-dahab-hotel.jpg","width":"50","height":"50"},"original":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/19/56/04/f2/star-of-dahab-hotel.jpg","width":"1125","height":"831"},"large":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/19/56/04/f2/star-of-dahab-hotel.jpg","width":"550","height":"406"},"medium":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/19/56/04/f2/star-of-dahab-hotel.jpg","width":"250","height":"185"}}}]},{"id":"710619870","lang":"en","location_id":"1762414","published_date":"2019-09-17T09:42:28-04:00","published_platform":"Mobile","rating":"5","type":"review","helpful_votes":"0","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297547-d1762414-r710619870-Star_Of_Dahab-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review710619870","travel_date":"2019-09","text":"Such a pleasant stay at this hotel, very welcoming and respectful staff, rooms are amazing and so clean, all the services they offer are wonderful and professional, hope to get back there again for such an enjoyable stay.

There were lots of restaurants in the area and a more bustling town area just a 5-10 minute walk away.  Had the smoothies and Egyptian breakfast everyday. \n\nThe location was great for diving and it was super safe - you could set your belongings down and come back to it later (which is helpful when diving).  Lots of friendly and healthy cats and dogs in the area too.\n\nAs an anecdote to the exceptional service and safety in the area - I lost my wallet two hours before when we were supposed to leave.  Sayid from Star of Dahab as well as the staff of Big Blue Dahab went above and beyond to track it down, making calls and looking through security footage.  It turns out that it had fallen out of my pocket and someone turned it in (money and cards in-tact) to the local police station.

The resort is very pretty and special. Wherever you look, you will find a perfect spot to take a photo! Authentic style of the buildings, mountains and desert on one side and the sea on the other, nicely designed territory. \n\nThe room was very clean. The beds were with comfortable mattresses and clean white linen. The only problem was in the bathroom that needed some maintenance: poor pressure of water in the shower, rusty faucet, the bathtub looked old and scratched. \n\nBreakfast was nice. It is not a buffet, they serve you a basket with bread and a plate with a boiled egg, jam, several kinds of cheese, cold cuts and sliced cucumbers. The coffee was very delicious (proper brewed coffee, not instant powder!), hot milk and powder orange drinks were also available. It was very lovely to sit on the terrace and enjoy the fresh sea breeze.\n\nSecurity was present on site at night, so it felt safe. The hotel is located about 20 minutes walk from the downtown, but reception can also arrange a taxi. The staff was friendly and polite.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my stay. I didn't expect much from a 2-star place, but this resort really exceeded my expectations. I would return for the next stay.","title":"Charming Place","subratings":[{"name":"Sleep Quality","value":"5"},{"name":"Cleanliness","value":"5"},{"name":"Service","value":"5"}],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false,"photos":[{"id":"352098557","locations":[{"name":"Lagona Dahab Hotel","id":"1166518","web_url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297547-d1166518-Reviews-Lagona_Dahab_Hotel-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html","intent_url":"tripadvisor:///Hotel_Review-g297547-d1166518-Reviews-Lagona_Dahab_Hotel-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html","parent_location_id":297547}],"published_date":"2018-10-09T08:58:17-0400","user":{"username":"Ellen_Landes","member_id":"0","user_id":"5FFD8726460406459050F750A628513F","type":"user","avatar":{"id":"350980334","caption":"Ellen_Landes","published_date":"2018-10-03T05:20:14-0400","helpful_votes":"0","is_blessed":false,"uploaded_date":"2018-10-03T05:20:14-0400","images":{"small":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/14/eb/88/ee/ellen-landes.jpg","width":"150","height":"150"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/14/eb/88/ee/ellen-landes.jpg","width":"50","height":"50"},"original":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/14/eb/88/ee/ellen-landes.jpg","width":"493","height":"493"},"large":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/14/eb/88/ee/ellen-landes.jpg","width":"450","height":"450"},"medium":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/14/eb/88/ee/ellen-landes.jpg","width":"205","height":"205"}}}},"helpful_votes":"0","is_blessed":false,"uploaded_date":"2018-10-09T08:58:17-0400","images":{"small":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/14/fc/98/fd/lagona-village-hotel.jpg","width":"150","height":"150"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/14/fc/98/fd/lagona-village-hotel.jpg","width":"50","height":"50"},"original":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/14/fc/98/fd/lagona-village-hotel.jpg","width":"812","height":"609"},"large":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/14/fc/98/fd/lagona-village-hotel.jpg","width":"550","height":"413"},"medium":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/14/fc/98/fd/lagona-village-hotel.jpg","width":"250","height":"188"}}}]},{"id":"576616800","lang":"en","location_id":"1166518","published_date":"2018-04-29T14:42:21-04:00","published_platform":"Desktop","rating":"1","type":"review","helpful_votes":"1","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297547-d1166518-r576616800-Lagona_Dahab_Hotel-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review576616800","travel_date":"2018-04","text":"Actually it was like they were surprised to have a group of people.\nthey have uncleaned pool, no room service, no soap, bad plumbing, small beds, no hot water.\nthe only pro was the location.\ni wouldn't recommend it unless someone need a bed to sleep","title":"Disappointment","subratings":[{"name":"Value","value":"3"},{"name":"Sleep Quality","value":"2"},{"name":"Service","value":"1"}],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false}],"location":{"coordinates":["28.56338","33.95445"],"address":"Dahab 46617 Egypt"}},{"id":"12168658","type":"HOTEL","name":"New Yalla Hotel","image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/c9/e6/47/new-yalla-hotel.jpg","awards":[],"rankingPosition":"33","priceLevel":"$","priceRange":"$51 - $58","category":"hotel","rating":3.5,"hotelClass":"0.0","phone":"+20 69 3642607","email":"stay@newyallahotel.com","amenities":[],"numberOfRooms":20,"prices":[],"webUrl":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297547-d12168658-Reviews-New_Yalla_Hotel-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html","website":"http://www.newyallahotel.com","rankingString":"#33 of 60 B&Bs / Inns in Dahab","rankingDenominator":"60","numberOfReviews":9,"reviews":[{"id":"813326182","lang":"en","location_id":"12168658","published_date":"2021-10-06T12:05:41-04:00","published_platform":"Desktop","rating":"5","type":"review","helpful_votes":"0","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297547-d12168658-r813326182-New_Yalla_Hotel-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review813326182","travel_date":"2021-10","text":"Everything always efficient, clean, clear and friendly.

It was amazing. I have been to many hotels in Dahab, but this one was great! \n\nCheck in: We called them right before we came because we had a problem with the hotel we were staying in and they said they had 3 rooms available, so we booked them and went. The staff were super friendly, helpful and welcoming and made sure we were settled quickly in our rooms as we were very devastated with the other hotel. Thanks a lot to Mr. Sabry who made sure that happened. \n\nRooms: The rooms are new with reasonable space (I assume it's a new hotel), the ACs work perfectly, clean sheets, clean bathroom and a free internet connection (although very poor connectivity, but it's something); However, just like most hotels, the lighting wasn't the best, but it was fine. Our rooms had a pool view and a little balcony. The toiletries weren't the best, only towels and tissues, but it's fine. It's recommended you get your own shampoo, water and stuff (it's a budget hotel after all).\n\nLocation: It's like a 3 minute walk from the Lighthouse. It has its own bar \"Yalla Bar\" which you get a 10% discount for on food because you're in the hotel. The hotel is surrounded by restaurants, cafes, shops, diving centers and supermarkets. \n\nA very highly recommended hotel.","title":"Absolutely the best","subratings":[{"name":"Rooms","value":"5"},{"name":"Value","value":"5"},{"name":"Service","value":"5"}],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false},{"id":"478297103","lang":"en","location_id":"12168658","published_date":"2017-04-23T11:24:39-04:00","published_platform":"Mobile","rating":"1","type":"review","helpful_votes":"0","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297547-d12168658-r478297103-New_Yalla_Hotel-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review478297103","travel_date":"2017-04","text":"I stayed for one night there, Thursday 20th April till 21st April.

minutes. \nThe staff helps you with everything, nothing is too much and I would like to thank Moses, Achmed and Mohamed for the service, what nice people. \nAlways up for a chat and a joke. \nThe restaurant and bar are also top notch. \nIn the evening there is a lot of atmosphere, nice music and very nice people. \nThe room is spacious and clean, the beds are good but the bathroom is a bit outdated. \nAll in all, my husband and I had a great time at your hotel.\nThank you so much for everything Coral Coast and we will definitely be back. \n\nGreetings, Corien and Ger Dijkhuizen from

The common areas inside the hotel and out on the beach are the perfect place to unwind and enjoy the views. A few minutes' walk along the seafront brings you into the center of Dahab, where you can find a host of restaurants, shops, and activities.

I enjoyed the experience. \n\nThat said, there are a number of points I would raise for improvement of this lovely property: \n1. The toilet was loose, when you sat on it, it would move and felt like it was coming away from the wall/floor.\n2. The fixtures in the bathroom were loose: the towel rack kept falling off the wall, the shower head fell out of the holder on the wall and the flush on the toilet would pop off.\n3. The water pressure was low, so it felt like you were showering with extremely little water.\n4. We had 3 beds in the room, and only 1 duvet.\n\nOn the other hand, we did enjoy the overall experience: there was a very efficient fridge, the AC was superb, there was decent wifi, the beds were comfortable, the staff went out of their way to help us with any request we had, the manager shared her whatsapp number so we could reach her anytime and the location of the motel is close to the beach, major restaurants and the dive centre we used. \n\nThe restaurant downstairs was lovely - we had breakfast there 5 out of 7 days and dinner twice. Simple, yet delicious food and it was very well priced compared to other restaurants.\n\nIf the management could look at improving the fixtures in the bathroom it would have been a perfect stay.","title":"Good, not excellent","subratings":[{"name":"Rooms","value":"4"},{"name":"Sleep Quality","value":"5"},{"name":"Service","value":"5"}],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false},{"id":"782299399","lang":"en","location_id":"21051807","published_date":"2021-02-04T03:52:08-05:00","published_platform":"Desktop","rating":"5","type":"review","helpful_votes":"1","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297547-d21051807-r782299399-Chill_Out_Motel-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review782299399","travel_date":"2021-01","text":"I came for one night and stayed for 1 month.

Ahmad and Moustafa'too work very hard to run any cores to keep the place at very high standard and always ready  for any requests as Ammar can arrange e any request and suggestions what to visit in Dahab...Lady Nahid the owner is the soul of Dar Dahab and working as Ammar ralways helpful with any requests or any problems...Maintenance is at very high standard and if something is not wprking properly will be repaired in very short time...The peace at Dar Dahab is broken only by children at sea playing even football !! Guests should be more caring  when stay at Dar Dahab because its extra work if come back from a swim and come iand should be n without taking off or washing their sea shoes in the basket water outside!!! Dah Dahab is like home: I have seen the staircase been washed 3 times in a day!!! If you like to sunbathing there is a great terrace well stock with chairs and  there are cushions where at the end of the you can see a sunset over the mountains...This year was very special to be back and as a chef its a pleasure to do some cooking for the guests..Lady Nahid also try to help ;new people come ti live in dahab and doing their roots cooking food but also they can suggest places in town or have take away...Any problem at Dar Dahab is not a problem because there is a way!! the wish to make your stay very relax without any issues of any sort....There si much more to say about Dar Dahab for its eco furnitures with a booking area too!! Dar Dahab is home for me and the only bad time its leaving time because you feel like taking a piece of Dar Dahab and want to give back when you come back with a great new experience vacation!!! i love it!!! And will come back...Thank you Lady Nahid, Ammar Moustafa and Ahmad....Will be back...its a homecoming...","title":"The gem of Dahab where you feel at home and will come back again and again..","owner_response":{"id":"875540026","lang":"en","published_date":"2023-01-18T06:28:30-05:00","connection":"Propriétaire","responder":"Noura El Rassi","text":"Thank you Alfonso!

hotel is an amazing residence in Dahab with unique architecture and beautiful lighting.  Each unit has a small kitchen, many have sea views and the lobby area is gorgeous.  My family stayed here many times and enjoyed snorkeling in front of the hotel as well as walking to the Light House area. Ms. Nahed, the owner, is present daily and always friendly.  Mr. Gamal( fabulous cook) and Mr. Walid (excellent service man) make every guest feel at home.  It is the best place to stay in Dahab.  This New Year’s Eve,  Ms. Nahed hosted a delicious dinner for the guests.  It was perfect.

for five nights with family and we had a sea view one bedroom as well as the two bedroom apartment (no view), So we enjoyed the best of both worlds: Space, and prime view. Rarely on the coast do accommodations offer any surprises. Dar Dahab exceeded expectations on all levels, service, welcome, comfort, space and tasteful design. Ammar, our hotel manager was there 24/7 and always ready to assist and accommodate all kinds of plan changes. He is so well connected that through him, we were guaranteed the best service bond the hotel, from restaurants to day trips and other water activities. We were treated like royalty and always told, Ammar is a dear client.  he gets an  array of eclectic clientele and all kids of purposeful trips: Yoga retreats, families, expats, hikers and more and yet, he spends time to understand his clients and manages to offer tailor made suggestions that always hit home successfully.

Ayman, the owner is so lovely, overseeing our every need from the moment we booked our reservation.  He is super attentive to all my questions of things to do, etc  He organized a pick up from Sharm El Sheik airport to the hotel and made the transfer seamless, even at midnight!\n\nThe hotel is so charming - the hotel is riad style and the rooms are spacious and unique.  I loved that it is just far enough from the beach walk where the bars and restaurants are to be quiet and calm.\n\nDon’t forget to get the breakfast at the hotel’s breakfast restaurant!  It is a locally known thing that breakfast at Alf Leila is amazing. Anastasia and the staff was wonderful in serving my group of 5 in a hurry to make our flight.  \n\nAnd what I loved the most - they make their own kamboucha! So hard to pick a flavor - so we got 3!\n\nCan’t wait to return, inshal’lah.

is a place of a great taste in design and architecture which is rare. Though it is center of Dahab, it is kinda out of noisy streets. And there is a nice trick about this place. They have a stylish breakfast cafe right inside the complex. Which serves the one and only salmon benedict in town. Rooms were clean and nice, though it is common. But the details are what catch the eye and make you fall in love with Alf Leila. All this Moroccan style musical instruments, plates and decor scattered around makes this stay not just a stay, but an experience. The owners told that they are renewing rooms to make them cleanest in Dahab, which is appreciated. Anyway, 10 out of 10, great job, loved it.","title":"Vibrant, relaxed and comfortable boutique.

Immediately i went down to the reception to ask to leave as this is a place no human can stay in. Mostafa in the reception was so polite, decent, and understanding and this guy is the only good thing in this hotel, he Immediately called Ayman the owner to ask him to give me my money back.\nHere was the surprise!!!\nThis guy called Ayman called me saying I can't leave and he will fix the issues I am complaining about and that's all he can do. He was very rude and didn't feel that they had any problem, he was even saying that in 5 stars hotels I may face similar situations and I am the one complicating things. This guy has zero experience in customer service, zero experience in management and zero communication skills.

First of all, we truly appreciate your honest feedback as a genuine opportunity to improve and offering us a path to get better. We addressed your issue right when you had a call with the manager although the conversation was on high tones from your side. We were truly shattered (sorry if you took the calm and polite tone of the owner as rudeness and being unprofessional, mentioning you even refused to meet him in person) We were willing to fix the room or offer you another one because we are as all humans can make mistakes and when we do we try to correct it. Unfortunately, our policy similar to the policy of the most local hotels don't entail an immediate refund if the second party doesn't accept a solution or an available alternative. \n As you've mentioned, there have been a lot of good reviews and people who genuinely enjoyed staying at our place and they still do and we reassure you they are humans. Besides we keep learning and developing. We offer you and your wonderful spouse sincere apologies again and we hope you forgive us and maybe give us another chance one day.

\n-Contact with Daniel (owner) was super nice and efficient \n-From initial contact to booking we exchanged few what’s apps and after 30 minutes the deal was sealed \n-I got quite a lot of hints from Daniel (where to exchange money, COVID regulations, VISA regulations, …) \n \nPick-up: \n-He offers connect to cab service \n-The cab was both times well on time (waiting for me) and price is unbeatable comparing to other offers\n\nPlace itself: \n-I had the „top floor apartment“ in the villa \n-Quite spacy for one person \n-2 bedrooms with total of 4 beds \n-Bathroom with shower and bathtub (incl. shower) \n-Kitchen with everything that is required \n-Pool looked nice and clean \n-Quite some areas to hang-out \n \nNeighborhood: \n-Feels very safe and relaxed \n-In nighttime no noise \n \nFood: \n-As Daniel was not in Dahab his assistant from the place next door takes care of breakfast \n-He was very approachable and helpful \n-Breakfast was actually quite nice \n-Breakfast is usually as of 0830 but the „chef“ proposed to open early for me… Was very kind and I got already breakfast at 0800am  \n \nDistance: \n-Bank at the corner (exchange EUR – local currency w/o a fee at the ATM)\n-Small store at the corner \n-Restaurants a few blocks \n-Ocean like 250m maybe (maybe less)\n-To the middle of Dahab where like all the action is approx. 15-25 min walk \n-Basically every car acts as a cab but I have walked all the time as it’s just a nice walk \n \nWhat to improve: \n-Wlan was sufficient for streaming but I think speed and connection could be improved (I hear it is a general issue in Dahab) considering this it was quite good 😊\n \nHighly recommend for everybody who appreciates space for a good price and does not need to be down-downtown.","title":"Worth a

This was not a problem for me and disturbed my sleep less than music and noise from cafes or restaurants would have done.\n\nThere are uninterrupted views to the mountains and also to the north of Dahab from the roof top.\n\nThe team were friendly and there was always someone around which I find reassuring.  \n\nA simple packed breakfast was delivered in the evening with bread, yoghurt, fruit, jam, honey, butter and soft cheese.  The in room fridge had plenty of room for this and to hold your drinks.\n\nThe bathroom was large and fully tiled so there was no problem using the hand held shower  over the bath even though there was no curtain.  Water pressure was good and there was always hot water.\n\nIf you are happy with a short walk to the main bay area, a bit of traffic noise and are looking for a room to use as a base this could be a good choice for you.\n\nA transfer to and from Sharm Airport was arranged via messages with Muhammad.  \n\nThank you to the team at the hotel for a comfortable stay.","title":"Comfortable room a short

They were well known by the owner(s) of Dahab Divers Lodge. When he told me they were very relaxed but fervent at the same time, I was expecting a nice experience. The real thing, however, has still taken me by surprise. From the first moment onwards they treated me like I was a friend, cracking jokes and laughing throughout the first orientation of the course. Later, when we met our diving instructor, I was waiting to see what type of person he was. He seemed to have been selected for the same reason so many people enjoy hanging out at the DDL: very relaxed, thorough and passionate when explaining diving concepts and always ready to answer any questions.\nTo make a long story short: I fell in love with Dahab and with diving because of the Dahab Divers Lodge, and I recommend everyone go to this place if you’re a complete beginner. No matter from where you start, you’ll leave this place a diver.\n\nMuch love,\nHendrik","title":"Simply the best.","subratings":[],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false,"photos":[{"id":"592144174","locations":[{"name":"Dahab Divers Lodge","id":"6925310","web_url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297547-d6925310-Reviews-Dahab_Divers_Lodge-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html","intent_url":"tripadvisor:///Hotel_Review-g297547-d6925310-Reviews-Dahab_Divers_Lodge-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html","parent_location_id":297547}],"published_date":"2022-05-02T08:47:38-0400","user":{"username":"896hendriks","member_id":"0","user_id":"B24781D17C2F7AC8AB562776BC5C0737","type":"user","avatar":{"id":"452389492","caption":"default-avatar-2020-68","published_date":"2020-02-21T16:08:22-0500","helpful_votes":"0","is_blessed":false,"uploaded_date":"2020-02-21T16:08:22-0500","images":{"small":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ea/74/default-avatar-2020-68.jpg","width":"150","height":"150"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/74/default-avatar-2020-68.jpg","width":"50","height":"50"},"original":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ea/74/default-avatar-2020-68.jpg","width":"1200","height":"1200"},"large":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1a/f6/ea/74/default-avatar-2020-68.jpg","width":"450","height":"450"},"medium":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1a/f6/ea/74/default-avatar-2020-68.jpg","width":"205","height":"205"}}}},"helpful_votes":"0","is_blessed":false,"uploaded_date":"2022-05-02T08:47:38-0400","images":{"small":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/23/4b/67/2e/dahab-divers-lodge.jpg","width":"150","height":"150"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/23/4b/67/2e/dahab-divers-lodge.jpg","width":"50","height":"50"},"original":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/23/4b/67/2e/dahab-divers-lodge.jpg","width":"1600","height":"1200"},"large":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/23/4b/67/2e/dahab-divers-lodge.jpg","width":"550","height":"413"},"medium":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/23/4b/67/2e/dahab-divers-lodge.jpg","width":"250","height":"188"}}}]},{"id":"836891294","lang":"en","location_id":"6925310","published_date":"2022-05-02T01:18:03-04:00","published_platform":"Desktop","rating":"5","type":"review","helpful_votes":"1","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297547-d6925310-r836891294-Dahab_Divers_Lodge-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review836891294","travel_date":"2022-05","text":"We had an awesome time at the Dahab Divers Lodge where my brother and 2 friends of us had our first experiences with diving by taking the Open Water Padi Course!

into a state if disrepair and you’ll often find things like a faulty toilet or burnt out lightbulbs or sheets that seem to have bought in 1996. But Dahab Divers Lodge is newly furnished, and very well maintained.

But the outstanding part was definitely Osama: he's one of the managers and probably the most helpful host I've had, he was always checking to see if we got everything we needed, would quickly solve any issues and requests we had even the ones not related directly to the hotel and also cared about our experience around Dahab. I honestly felt like I was home. It was a good service for a good price.

We met Tito who works there and who promised us a trip there full of good surprises with a group of people that have already signed in. We paid 500EGP each in advance as requested (the trip was planned for two days later) but, of course, the following day we received a WhatsApp message from him with a funny excuse: \"the trip is cancelled because of the hot wheather and the police wouldn't let us through.\" It was planned to be 38°, as pretty much every day in Dahab at this time of the year. But hey, he promised us that the trip would take place another two days later. And again, the following day, we received message saying that the trip is cancelled...because he actually didn't have enough people.\n\nSo we had to go back to the Jasmine hotel to get our money back.

If you are looking for 5* luxury complete with air-con and room service at the end of the phone, then this is probably not the place for you! However, if you are looking for budget accommodation which is clean and friendly with first-class hosts, Hassan and Salama, then look no further! Sit in the harisha, traditional sunken sitting area covered in colourful rugs and cushions, and meet fellow travellers and holiday-makers from all around the world! Or you can swing in the camp's hammock and read one of the books from Sindbad's library! Amazing welcome, amazing food from the Sindbad kitchen and amazing atmosphere! Sindbad is at the quieter northern end of Dahab and is just a stone's throw from stunning snorkelling at the Lighthouse reef where you can just wade out into the water and swim among the fish! It is also just a few minutes' walk from all the restaurants and cafes along the seafront.

It was an authentic bedouin camp that was very laid back and comfortable. The staff was incredibly helpful. The food was amazing! Make sure to try Moses's breakfast. It was something special. The location is perfect for Dahab. Its not on the main strip but a 1 minute walk. It adds to the laid-back atmosphere being around the corner from the action. Overall, an amazing experience and absolutely recommend!","title":"One of the coolest hostels I've ever stayed at","subratings":[{"name":"Rooms","value":"5"},{"name":"Value","value":"5"},{"name":"Service","value":"5"}],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false}],"location":{"coordinates":["28.499973","34.52046"],"address":"Masbath Road, Dahab 1000NN Egypt"}},{"id":"1155365","type":"HOTEL","name":"Seaview Hotel","image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/12/9d/c5/beach-area.jpg","awards":[],"rankingPosition":"31","priceLevel":"$","priceRange":"$43 - $52","category":"hotel","rating":4.5,"hotelClass":"3.0","hotelClassAttribution":"This property is classified according to Giata.","phone":"+20 69 3641272","email":"info@seaviewdahab.com","amenities":[],"numberOfRooms":22,"prices":[],"webUrl":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297547-d1155365-Reviews-Seaview_Hotel-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html","website":"http://www.seaviewdahab.com/","rankingString":"#31 of 97 hotels in Dahab","rankingDenominator":"97","numberOfReviews":98,"reviews":[{"id":"864163296","lang":"en","location_id":"1155365","published_date":"2022-10-11T15:20:35-04:00","published_platform":"Desktop","rating":"5","type":"review","helpful_votes":"0","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297547-d1155365-r864163296-Seaview_Hotel-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review864163296","travel_date":"2022-10","text":"I am writing this review to share my personal experience in seaview.

used to be good, now it's a stay-away-from junk.\nI stayed in this hotel two times before, in summer 2015 and 2016, both were very good visits. However, my most recent visit was traumatizing (August 2020). \nThe hotel used to be safe for families and women, now in 2020 It's not. The manager and one member of the staff verbally harassed me and my sister. They moved forward with their unacceptable behaviour and attempted at suggesting to get us into some uncanny situations. We were able to put them in their places.\nThe management didn't honour their agreement with us too. Before booking the room, we agreed on a late check-out. Having stayed for five days without being requested to expedite the check-out time, the management, out of nowhere, unilaterally decided to evoke the agreement in our very last day of the visit. They \"instructed\" us to leave 5 hours before the agreed time. We had to interrupt our activities, rush to the hotel and get ready to leave. We ended up spending the last 5 hours of our trip tired and angry until the bus departure time. \nWe gave the owner the benefit of the doubt, assuming these violations were inflicted without his knowledge. We thought he'd listen as we know him from the previous visits when he used to run the hotel himself. I am sorry to say after two long calls, he was only annoyed for how much a review we wrote to the hotel FB page would cost him money. \nWe're both disappointed and sorry. It's a shame such a nice hotel had to be sunk into this level of unprofessional and unethical behaviour.","title":"worest manager ever even from the owner of the hotel , it's not safe , Harassment","subratings":[{"name":"Sleep Quality","value":"1"},{"name":"Cleanliness","value":"1"},{"name":"Service","value":"1"}],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false},{"id":"743613710","lang":"en","location_id":"1155365","published_date":"2020-02-07T13:36:33-05:00","published_platform":"Mobile","rating":"5","type":"review","helpful_votes":"1","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297547-d1155365-r743613710-Seaview_Hotel-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review743613710","travel_date":"2020-02","text":"From the moment they picked us up we were treated like family.

I had to change the room twice because of problems with the facilities and I ended up with a room with a broken AC remote control.\nYou don't feel clean around; the WC as an example, I felt like I want to wash my hand after using the sink! so you can imagine the feeling after using the toilet! They don't provide sope BTW. And the water is very salty, so taking a shower is not that refreshing.\nThere was many people around who were neither guests nor staff which was uncomfortable and unprofessional.\nAs a conclusion, I've been to simpler camps and less equipped places.

My friend and I were eaten alive that night by mosquitoes even with a plugin to help out. That clearly didn't work. We had to cover our entire bodies up with our heads inside the sheet to get some relief. Our fan didn't work either so you an imagine how hot it was. It was one of the most uncomfortable nights I've ever had. So sure, the landscape/sitting area is nice, but it's also mosquito infested. There are plenty of places to escape from these bloodsuckers but you will not find relief here. Sorry. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Plus, I found an even cheaper room at a hotel the next day that was bigger, had its own bathroom inside, hot water, a working fan, and 1/10th the mosquito problems.","title":"How does this place have such good reviews??","subratings":[{"name":"Rooms","value":"1"},{"name":"Location","value":"2"},{"name":"Service","value":"3"}],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false},{"id":"426554363","lang":"en","location_id":"611850","published_date":"2016-10-09T23:59:40-04:00","published_platform":"Mobile","rating":"5","type":"review","helpful_votes":"0","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297547-d611850-r426554363-Bishbishi_Garden_Village-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review426554363","travel_date":"2016-10","text":"That was awesome , the staff and the owner was really friendly , view is lovely .\nRoom & service and quality was perfect.\nI had a great time in bishbishi \nI recommend this place to anyone who love to come to dahab ","title":"The best place ever in Dahab","subratings":[],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false}],"location":{"coordinates":["28.490932","34.515106"],"address":"Mashraba St., Dahab Egypt"}},{"id":"1568450","type":"HOTEL","name":"Sunsplash","image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/02/58/28/a4/sunsplash.jpg","awards":[],"rankingPosition":"12","category":"hotel","rating":4.5,"hotelClass":"0.0","phone":"0020-(0)12-881 49 23","amenities":[],"numberOfRooms":12,"prices":[],"webUrl":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297547-d1568450-Reviews-Sunsplash-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html","rankingString":"#12 of 60 B&Bs / Inns in Dahab","rankingDenominator":"60","numberOfReviews":37,"reviews":[{"id":"882865695","lang":"en","location_id":"1568450","published_date":"2023-03-20T03:40:43-04:00","published_platform":"Desktop","rating":"5","type":"review","helpful_votes":"0","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297547-d1568450-r882865695-Sunsplash-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review882865695","travel_date":"2023-03","text":"Great value hotel located by the beach to the southern, quieter, end of the main tourist area.

had the pleasure of staying here for four nights and it felt like being at home thanks to the warm hospitality of the staff and the owner (and Eldo the cat) and the positive vibe of the place. The room was comfortable and clean. A sandy beach with deck chairs was literally right outside, where you could witness an amazing sunrise over the Red Sea. The lodge rooms surround the lovely restaurant area, which means the rooms are not quiet (though the music playlist is excellent), but this also means being able to eat some of the best Italian food I’ve ever had, including in Italy—the current owner of Eldorado is Italian from Puglia and is an excellent chef who obviously trained his attentive team well. Every day I was greeted with smiles and I was also delighted to find some vegan items on the food and drink menus. The location is perfect, walking distance from the Lighthouse area but in a quieter neighbourhood, and the setting gorgeous. Airport pick up and local tours can be arranged, just ask. Thank you to the whole Eldorado team for a really pleasant stay and I hope to be back soon!

We often ended up at Jays most afternoons because of its location, friendly staff and great strawberry smoothies.\n\nThe rooms themselves are basic, but what more do you need than a bathroom, bed and somewhere to put your clothes. \nWe did have room 4 to start with which does have a slight smell to it because of the drainage but got moved to room 2 after a couple of hours without even asking which was absolotuly fine and perfect for our week long dive holiday.\n\nAhmed the on-site man is great and will help you with whatever you need. Claire the owner was fantastically helpful with emails before we arrived in Dahab, recommending dive centres, horse riding and various excursions. \n\nWe would definitely stay here again and would recommend to divers looking to spend their cash on diving rather than a 5* hotel.

But it has simply got worse over time. My room has not been serviced at all within twelve days that I stayed, and I do not feel that safe as a woman on my own.  The only staff member seems to hate his job and his life, as he even told ,me, and wants to share his misery with others. He thumps around all day and has little logic. I have a TV and decoder but there is no extension cord and the cables are not connected. The staff member comes in at a three or four day interval to tell me an engineer will come to fix it all up as well as the non working AC, but he never arrives. It is a bit of an asylum really. I had a big mishap due to the unfixed AC whereby my room is boiling at night when sleeping / trying to sleep.  Half asleep in the middle of the night I opened the door to get some cooler air in the room and fell asleep naked before closing the door again I awoke naked in the morning with the door open. The windows are nailed shut except for the bathroom window which is tiny. I think the staff member was perving at me while I was sleeping and I smelled cigarette smoke when i awoke.. He changed his manner to super nasty and acted like a psycho  and I think that the cats got beaten up that morning. They were hiding under outdoor furniture in terror. Maybe this hotel is fine for Arab males to stay, but I would say that is about it these days. Once again I hesitate to recommend this hotel to females and even foreigners. One does not feel that welcome and there is an air of neglect and dissonance, especially with the staff member who needs a counseling service and medication.\nMainly I gave this bad review due to the bad service and unsafe staff member.  Otherwise it would have got a better rating.","title":"Bad manners and aggressive","subratings":[{"name":"Rooms","value":"3"},{"name":"Value","value":"4"},{"name":"Service","value":"1"}],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false}],"location":{"coordinates":["28.493898","34.51486"],"address":"Mashraba St, Dahab 46617 Egypt"}},{"id":"19350967","type":"HOTEL","name":"Golden Plaza Dahab Resort","image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/76/dd/8e/flat-screen-t-v.jpg","awards":[],"rankingPosition":"41","priceLevel":"$","priceRange":"$27 - $34","category":"hotel","rating":4.5,"hotelClass":"0.0","phone":"+20 127 977 3422","email":"goldenplazadahab1@gmail.com","amenities":[],"numberOfRooms":28,"prices":[],"webUrl":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297547-d19350967-Reviews-Golden_Plaza_Dahab_Resort-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html","website":"https://www.facebook.com/Golden-Plaza-Dahab-Resort-106683760772366/","rankingString":"#41 of 97 hotels in Dahab","rankingDenominator":"97","numberOfReviews":13,"reviews":[{"id":"833278394","lang":"en","location_id":"19350967","published_date":"2022-04-03T06:41:10-04:00","published_platform":"Mobile","rating":"4","type":"review","helpful_votes":"1","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297547-d19350967-r833278394-Golden_Plaza_Dahab_Resort-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review833278394","travel_date":"2022-03","text":"Last week I spent 5 nights there.

girlfriend and I spent almost a week at Sukoon guest house, and it was phenomenal!!. Ramy, the host, was very friendly and specific about the details of the place. Booking was fairly easy and straightforward and he even arranged a pick up for us from Sharm el Sheikh airport. Upon arrival, we had a very warm welcome, were given a quick tour around the place. The place is eco-friendly and there’s a place for food waste (compost) as well. The rooms are simple and very comfortable with a unique design and lots of sunlight. The guest house is designed for travellers, so if you are thinking of a 5 star service, this place is not for you! This is a place for people who seek simplicity, peace , and quiet! Ramy also has lots of contacts in Dahab and was able to put us in touch with different places to do different activities (diving, safari, snorkelling, etc.). All his recommendations were excellent and we didn’t have any trouble at all! The location is ideal; it’s right on the strip where all the restaurants are, we didn’t need to take a cab anytime during our stay.\nWe had such a wonderful time and were sad to leave :( (we even extended our stay 1 extra night) we will definitely be back!","title":"Simply...AMAZING!","subratings":[],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false},{"id":"816342833","lang":"fr","location_id":"19323118","published_date":"2021-10-28T03:56:16-04:00","published_platform":"Desktop","rating":"5","type":"review","helpful_votes":"0","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297547-d19323118-r816342833-Sukoon_Guest_House-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review816342833","travel_date":"2021-10","text":"j'avais besoin d'une retraite pour 5 jours, Sukoon m'a apporté l'essentiel ; calme, propreté, sérénité,  bienveillance.

Dahab is extremely beautiful. There was a great mix of families, couples (old and young) locals from Egypt and expats through out the village.\n\nPenguin Village is located at the southern end of the market strip in Dahab. It is a short 5 minute walk to the centre of Dahab's market district. Penguin village is at the quieter end of town and if you are a light sleeper it is likely the spot for you.\n\nBreakfast at Penguin Village was included in the package we bought and we always had tasty food with a great experience. \n\nThe staff at the front desk (Hany, Abdul, Mohammed and Osama) all consistently went out of their way to help us at any chance or request and their English skills are superb. I cannot thank them enough for making our stay a breeze. The staff provided simple or in depth information on everything from recommending places to see, tours to go on, organizing a taxi to and from the airport and directing us to services like laundromats. I cannot speak highly enough of the service.\n\nAnything that was lacking in the room was made up for by the outstanding service.\n","title":"Would return in a heart beat. Highly recommend!!!

Its prime location near restaurants and diving spots offers easy access to the best that the town has to offer, while being blissfully quiet in the evenings. The indoor-outdoor design of the hotel creates a warm and inviting atmosphere. The staff is incredibly helpful and friendly, always eager to ensure that guests find a room that suits their needs. The restaurant is cozy and comfortable, very laid back, and they serve delicious food. The pool lounge area is a standout feature, one of the most beautiful in the entire town. Often guests stay there all day for an entire week, it's so nice. And i you're an animal lover, the hotel's friendly cats will bring an extra dose of warmth and comfort to your stay.

While it was perhaps a bit more expensive than average in the town, it was worth every penny. Firstly, the team running the hotel were lovely and super accommodating: Badr in particular made me feel totally at home and was always ready to help with a smile. He had lots of great sightseeing tips from personal experience and found out about a local tour for me.\n\nIn terms of location, the hotel is a 10 minute walk from the main town, set back from the coast on one side and on a main road with handy shops on the other side. It’s incredibly peaceful and was ideal for a relaxing holiday. \n\nMy room had a sea view: while the sea was in the distance, my room looked over the pool which is surrounded by palm trees swaying the breeze. The room itself was very clean, spacious and nicely decorated, with a lovely private balcony, a private bathroom, good storage (a wardrobe and drawers), a fridge, and other amenities on hand from the front desk.\n\nIn terms of ambience, the hotel overall was beautifully decorated with plants and local crafts. It’s also worth saying that the price includes breakfast in the restaurant opposite the hotel, by the coast: it was always substantial and the sea view made it a perfect way to start the day! \n\nTwo small things I think could make a stay even better would be for the hotel to have a list of recommended excursions and taxi drivers on hand. Secondly, the shower in the bathroom was a little small and the space was tighter because the shower curtain was quite big.\n\nOverall I would 100% recommend a stay here when visiting Dahab, I came

hotel was about an hour from Sharm el Sheik, the roads were very good through the desert and mountains until we passed through Dahab when they became very rough. The actual location of the hotel is somewhat isolated although there is a regular free shuttle bus into Dahab The hotel bedrooms could do with some refurbishment but the grounds were very well maintained and and there was a lovely pool area which led directly onto a private beach.  There was a pier which allowed you to access deeper water and the coral reef.  Lots of fish to be seen when the water was calm.  The entertainment team was very enthusiastic especially Ouija and Alaa, who also performed in the evenings in the outdoor theatre.  The fire show was great and the belly dancer also.   \nFood in the restaurant was a bit samey but plentiful although it could have been a bit hotter.  The breakfast included very good bread and pastries. Overall it was the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff who would tempt us to return in the future.","title":"two week break","subratings":[{"name":"Value","value":"5"},{"name":"Cleanliness","value":"5"},{"name":"Service","value":"5"}],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false}],"location":{"coordinates":["28.551666","34.51759"],"address":"Blue Hole Road, Dahab 00087 Egypt"}},{"id":"1215761","type":"HOTEL","name":"Red Sea Relax Resort","image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/18/33/d9/b6/resort-view.jpg","awards":[],"rankingPosition":"11","priceLevel":"$","priceRange":"$63 - $82","category":"hotel","rating":4.5,"hotelClass":"3.0","hotelClassAttribution":"This property is classified according to Giata.","phone":"+20 114 026 6444","email":"info@red-sea-relax.com","amenities":[],"numberOfRooms":20,"prices":[],"webUrl":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297547-d1215761-Reviews-Red_Sea_Relax_Resort-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html","website":"http://www.red-sea-relax.com","rankingString":"#11 of 97 hotels in Dahab","rankingDenominator":"97","numberOfReviews":465,"reviews":[{"id":"882732456","lang":"en","location_id":"1215761","published_date":"2023-03-19T05:19:30-04:00","published_platform":"Mobile","rating":"5","type":"review","helpful_votes":"0","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297547-d1215761-r882732456-Red_Sea_Relax_Resort-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review882732456","travel_date":"2023-03","text":"The best things about this hotel are it’s fantastic location right in the heart of the main area & also the lovely staff who went out of their way to be helpful.

I read a few and who knew that would become my experience?! If you are reading this and contemplating then look further. The hotel smelled like an ashtray since they allow people to smoke inside. Also, their bed was old and the sheets were of low quality. It was so thin that you could see the mattress. Lastly, the hot water didn't work well. I didn't know what to say after seeing a stream of black water coming down the faucet. Their breakfast was awful too. There were so many flies and some of them ended up in the food. Staying in this hotel made my trip miserable so I had to switch to another one which was so much better. If you aren't sure about the hotel, just book a day and see if it works for you.

a stay! \nI was alone underway for a windsurfing holiday - and never b4 in Egypt. After booking the room, Fiona and Toby (who are perfectly conntected to the Dahab-every day live) contacted me for further information and any help. A shuttle from Sharm-el Sheich was organised; I got information about fair and realistic prices in taxis/restaurants/activities; I could asked everything I wanted (weather/wind/choice of wetsuit)! \nWhen I came first in the appartement, everything was clean (top!) and decorated with fresh flowers. Water and small foods were already there. I got instructions - in the right, appropriate way.\nWow - that is what I call a perfect hospitality. Gold standart and better.\n\nI never had a feeling of being alone or being a \"normal\" tourist. It felt more like being a foreign family member. I never had such a god organisation and safe, clean, uncomplicate stay like in this very comfy appartement. For everyone, who does not like to stay in a hotel and wants to get connected easily - go for Fiona and Toby. I strongly recommend.","title":"Outstanding stay!","owner_response":{"id":"846607219","lang":"en","published_date":"2022-07-07T00:07:46-04:00","connection":"Owner","responder":"Fiona Gibson","text":"Thank you for your lovely review.

Overall the quality of the apartment and homely feel to it is excellent.  Some apartments in Dahab can be quite \"barren\" and not exactly a \"European standard\".  Not so here!  Our apartment was beautifully appointed and furnished and the kitchen had more utensils than I think I do at home!  The garden is peaceful and sunny and well sheltered from the famous Dahab breeze.  The garden has pretty flowers, grass and a small pool to cool off in during the summer months.  Again grass is a varity in Dahab, so this was really a proper garden to relax in!  The property is just minutes walk away from the beach, both public and hotel beaches are available, both with very affordable food / snacks / sunloungers etc....  \n\nThere are also a few small shops nearby for daily essentials, an ATM, and a store that sells alcohol too should you wish an afternoon beer in the garden.\n\nI am sure there are cheaper places possible in Dahab, but for what you pay staying here is excellent value for money for the quality of the apartment and the location.  There is zero traffic noise compared to many other noisy areas in town.  What really makes staying here are Toby and Fiona themselves who are always available via WhatsApp or phone call and live just minutes away.  They've lived here for over 15 years and know Dahab from restaurants to snorkeling spots inside out.  We stayed here for a full 3 months and their advise on everything from taxis to visas was invaluable.  They have both worked in hospitality and tourism for most of their working lives and make excellent hosts, I can't praise them enough!  Full marks from me and I really hope to come back 10/10!","title":"Home away from home in Dahab!","owner_response":{"id":"846606369","lang":"en","published_date":"2022-07-07T00:01:18-04:00","connection":"Owner","responder":"Fiona Gibson","text":"Thank you for your fab review.

week at the seahorse apartment in the lagoon villa were amazing. The cozy and modern apartment and beautiful garden exceeded our expectations. We especially loved how private the apartment and garden are and will always prefer such an individual experience to large hotels. There is another apartment in the property, but we never saw or heard our neighbours and had the garden all to ourselves.\nThe apartment itself has modern furniture and all the amenities and kitchen supplies one might need. The highlight is definitely the spacious terrace and charming garden with a small pool.\nThe property is easy to reach. It is located in a quiet neighbourhood, the beach is just a 5-minute walk away. The city center is approximately 10 minutes by car.\nTobias and Fiona are great hosts and helped us on our way through the first days on the peninsula. \nWe are looking forward to coming back since we felt at home since the very first day.","title":"Cozy apartment with beautiful garden and great hosts","owner_response":{"id":"827632194","lang":"en","published_date":"2022-02-11T22:43:28-05:00","connection":"Owner","responder":"Fiona Gibson","text":"Thank you for your lovely review.

Its very clean and cosy and its even better than the pictures!\n\nCommunication was very smooth and they did their best to organize an early check-in for our arrival. They offered us essentials in the fridge which was very nice of them. They were always available through Whatsapp and gave us awesome tips to enjoy Dahab :). \n\nWe were lucky to spend two days alone in the whole place. But the place is designed in a way we didn’t come across our neighbor. So, it was perfect privacy wise. \n \nThe chalet’s location is perfect. It is right next to a super market and the public beach is nearby but there are also different hotels where you can access their beaches as a day use. El mamsha is just approximately 10 mins by car and you can find taxis everywhere. \n\nI’d definitely recommend staying at Tobi and Fiona’s place. They are great hosts! Thank you guys for everything.

So happy to have discovered Fi and Toby on this site and their lovely Seahorse apartment. Very communicative throughout (1st trip to Dahab). Organised bike hire, which was very reasonably priced. So, it was a 10 - 15 minute cycle to Downtown each day, or a leisurely 3 minute walk to the lagoon. Having breakfast at The Swiss hotel as recommended by Fi and Toby. So many useful recommendations and offers of help throughout my stay, I will visit again for sure! The actual apartment is stylish, clean, safe, cosy  and even has a Lavazza coffee machine!

On this occasion, my family and I had just ordered lunch at the Restaurant, and my two brothers and I laid out towels on the sand in an empty space closest to the sea and sat on the beach (we knew that you had to rent the sunbeds, so we did not go near them), while our parents remained seated at the Restaurant table. A man wearing no identifying uniform or name tag came to tell us we had to get up and leave or pay to stay sitting there. My brother speaks fluent Arabic, and asked him who he was and where was this rule that we had to pay to simply sit on the beach, if we were paying guests of the Restaurant. Therefore this man, who we later discovered to be a \"beach boy\" named Mohammed, walked my brother to the reception, rudly saying \"Don't you speak Arabic to me\" and \"You talk too much\". We did not have an issue with there being a fee, it was the manner in which we were told to get up and leave by Mohammed, despite being clients of the resort. The reception simply made excuses for Mohammed's behaviour, and did not acknowledge the two e-mails I sent the owner, simply asking for an apology.\n\nThink twice about deciding to stay here or visit their restaurant; despite there being very pleasant employees such as the restaurant staff, the way this event was handled says a lot with regards to client handling, in English, Arabic, or any other language.\n\nDon't ruin you stay in wonderful Dahab by choosing the Ganet Sinai.","title":"Rude and lacking - definitely would NOT recommend","subratings":[{"name":"Service","value":"1"}],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false},{"id":"701928665","lang":"en","location_id":"585175","published_date":"2019-08-22T11:28:47-04:00","published_platform":"Mobile","rating":"4","type":"review","helpful_votes":"0","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297547-d585175-r701928665-Ganet_Sinai_Resort-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review701928665","travel_date":"2019-08","text":"I never stayed here but we are eating frequently at the restaurant because are using the surf school next door.

This year I had my family and explained that we are staying at 2 stars hotel to limit their expectations , yet the place was wonderful.  The receptionist Mr.Ashraf  was professional and very supportive , rooms were as expected small but clean and comfortable. House keeping did a good job . Restaurant was nice with wonderful staff especially with our kids and food was excellent,  we all enjoyed it especially that we had an outdoor BBQ which was so delecious.\nSwimming pool is clean and safe for kids , I left my kids swimming alone with the life guard. Beach is the best in Dahab , sandy beach with calm water were wonderful for relaxing . In addition that the place is the best location for windsurfing and parasailling.  Hotel location is 5 min by car to downtime and hotel had pharmacy and mini market. \nI am sure that we will revisit this hotel again and again :)","title":"Exceeded our expectations ","subratings":[],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false},{"id":"590750582","lang":"en","location_id":"585175","published_date":"2018-06-25T19:10:55-04:00","published_platform":"Mobile","rating":"4","type":"review","helpful_votes":"1","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297547-d585175-r590750582-Ganet_Sinai_Resort-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review590750582","travel_date":"2018-05","text":"My husband and I had a truly wonderful holiday.

in Amanda Hotel was a great experience, the owners, Rita and Sammy are amazing people, kind, helpful, with a good humour. I really felt at home. The breakfast Ali makes will start your day, it's plentiful, fresh and delicious.\nThe rooms are neat and comfy, the common spaces are super, beautiful exotic flowers everywhere, great for relaxing. Everything is closeby, shops, restaurants, still it has a quiet, calm setting. Right by the hotel the reef is great for snorkeling, stunning coral and marine wildlife, Eel garden is just next doors. On top of all this, they have a lovely, smart, playful puppy, Luna, whose company will always light up your days. \nWatch out, if you come to Dahab and stay in Amanda, you might find it really hard to leave (your new home and family :) )\nThanks for everything guys, definitely see you next time!","title":"Your new home in Dahab :)","subratings":[{"name":"Sleep Quality","value":"5"},{"name":"Location","value":"5"},{"name":"Service","value":"5"}],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false},{"id":"548240559","lang":"en","location_id":"7932771","published_date":"2017-12-20T08:06:57-05:00","published_platform":"Mobile","rating":"5","type":"review","helpful_votes":"0","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297547-d7932771-r548240559-Amanda_Yoga_Hotel-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review548240559","travel_date":"2017-12","text":"The common story in Dahab is \"Come as a guest, leave as a friend\" But at Amanda, it's .... come as a guest, leave as family !!

What can you say about this place. Every one we met staying there were repeat visitors as we will be next year too. Their new puppy Luna  was a real treat and we got to watch her grow up.

looked at many guesthouses when I arrived in Dahab. I discovered there was a big difference in offerings of guesthouses and hotels in the same price range. Amanda was in a more serene and private part of the tourist area but still within walking distance of the action. The rooms were bright and spacious and airy and the view and sound of the sea on the semi-private beach from my room was the best part. The owner, Said, was friendly and very knowledgeable and helpful. The beachfront lounging area was beautiful and comfortable enough to stay all day and the restaurant actually had healthy meals with a variety of vegetables. The yoga studio was not hosting classes at the time I was there so I got to use the whole space to myself for self-practice. This place is truly wonderful and unquestionably the best value for the money in the area.","title":"Gorgeous, peaceful, clean and kind retreat in Dahab","subratings":[{"name":"Sleep

there\nAND you’ll be meeting the great stuff you can see in the photos -missing wegz el ghalaba, Mohsen, and many more- so please say hi to them all and let them know i miss them already ❤️❤️\n\nThank

Safes in the room with fridge, kettle. Outside each door is a fire extinguisher. \nThere are lower sea view rooms facing the Arisha.\nThe garden has been beautifully renovated with garden rooms. The rooms are spotless, clean, fresh. With nice closets.and lots of space.\nMy favourite part is the Arisha on the beach. Its cozy, relaxed, chilled and absolutely a wonderful place for reading, chilling, staying out of the sun, chatting.\nIf the wind peaks up you can still sit out side or in the Arish. The beach is spotless and clean with great bedouin seating.\nFridays are not to be missed when the entire community comes for Friday Market. Where food, crafts, art, clothing and many other things are sold.\nMost of all they have an incredible group of young dynamic people working as a team to give you an authentic Bedouin experience.\nGreat place for children, famalies, couples, friends travelling together or solo travellers. Great place for a sunset, moon rise or sunrise walk, or just for gazing.\nNew lights are  being installed along the entire beach area.\n\nIts a few minutes walk to an endless number of restaurants, laundry service, market\nA few minutes walk to Aasala where you can eat fresh fish, buy fruits, a few grocerie stores, places to buy wine and beer. Egyptian bakery, German bakery. A vegan soup bar. Several places to eat fresh fish caught. You can buy grilled chicken. There is a \npharmacy.\n\nA few minutes walk to the Light House\nWhere you will find other restaurants, bars, shops, snorket and diving places, bakeries, Indian, Russian , Italian and Egyptian Resturants. Another great Vegan Resturant near by.\n\nFor those who like to run, walk , bike  and exercise in the morning or sunset. A few great places to run include from Sheikh Salem to Lagoona. Sheilk Salem is the most beautiful part of the beach area in Dahab.\n\nAsk Mohamed Amr and his team at the Soul of Sinai to organise day trips or multi day trips. To St Katherine, desert mediations, desert hikes and walks. \nWant to learn about Bedouin culture, music and food then sit in the Arisha and hear about the stories or take a trip with the team who will show you a truely authentic local experience.\n\nYoga, Meditation and those who enjoy quiet calm and relaxed atmosphere:\nThis a great place to stay if you enjoy calm, relaxed atmosphere away from bars and restaurants. Those who want to mediate, do yoga and have a spirtual journey. This is again a wonderful place to stay.\n\nI highly recommend Sheikh Salem for a truely authentic local experience in Dahab , the Sinai with a wonderul group of people  who will take care of you and make you feel at home.","title":"Fantastic atmosphere, chilled, relaxed, great rooms","subratings":[{"name":"Sleep Quality","value":"5"},{"name":"Cleanliness","value":"5"},{"name":"Service","value":"5"}],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false},{"id":"436881080","lang":"en","location_id":"629091","published_date":"2016-11-13T09:29:05-05:00","published_platform":"Mobile","rating":"4","type":"review","helpful_votes":"0","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297547-d629091-r436881080-Sheikh_Salem_House-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review436881080","travel_date":"2016-11","text":"it's clean.\ngreat hospitality.\nvery good location and beach.\nthey can get u anything u want and suggest where to go and make the needed arrangments for u.\nFelt home :)\ni don't think i will stay anywhere else.\nI loved the food market they organize every friday.

I have been staying at Sheikh Salem House since 2006. This year it was closed for a few months for renovations and I was lucky it opened in time for my stay on this trip to Dahab. \n\nI am staying at Sheikh Salem House from April 9 to May 3 2013. I am writing from there now.\nThe rooms are spotless and clean. The beds are very comfortable. The best part is the wonderful hot shower with fresh water, not salty water. Lots of counter space for two ladies, good light in the bathroom. On this trip I was staying in the garden room, rather then the sea room for a change. The room is quiet, with full afternoon sunlight in the afternoon.\nThe staff are very friendly, accommodating. Ahmed who works in the Arisha makes fantastic Eyptian lemonade. He is very helpful. Shahah is also very helpful and cleans the rooms till it is spotless.  When I arrived I wanted stronger light, hooks and a table put in and they were done immediately.\n\nThe Arisha ( a bedouin tent covered with palm leaves on the beach is cosy and a great place to chill and hang out, with new cushions, carpets which are dusted and cleaned daily. You can enjoy Shisha, coffee, juice. The kitchen has also just opened.\nThis is the best location anywhere in Dahab. Its quiet  as its the last hotel on the beach, great place to snorkel and swim with shallow water infront of the hotel.\nThe hotel has two bikes available for guests to use if they wish.\nShort walk to Assalya the Bedouin village with a market, super market, liquor store where you can get beer, wine, drinks, a few fish restaurants, fresh fruit and vegetable market.\nYou can easily walk to the light house area which is filled with restaurants of every type, shops, nightclubs, banks, post office.\nEvery morning I take a long w\nEvery day I walk along the beach  for about an hour, then take the bike and cycle all the way to lagoona.\nEvery Friday the Friday Market(Souk El Gomma) takes place at Sheikh Salem. Where you can buy clothes, foods from around the world.\n\nSome days the winds pick up and we all gather in the Arisha to be out of the wind and read, send e mails, have a Shisha, bedouin tea... a really relaxing  atmosphere\n\nMy favourite time of the year to come to Dahab is in March, April and early May. However I have also enjoyed it in November, December and February.\n\nThe Dahab Bedouin Festival in April will give you the chance to  experience and learn about Bedouin Culture, food, music and medicines from the earth. An exciting camel race during the festival is highly popular.   There are activities for solo travellers, families, friends. The South Sinai Bedouin are incredibly friendly, helpful and their hospitality is legendary\n \nThose who stay in the sea view rooms get the sunrise and in the evening the sun setting on the water.  Those who stay in the garden room can also enjoy it right on the beach.\n\nIt does not matter what time of the year .. I would highly recommend the new and refurbished Sheikh Salem House in Dahab..","title":"Best Location, redone, refurbished, revived same charm!","subratings":[{"name":"Rooms","value":"4"},{"name":"Value","value":"4"},{"name":"Sleep Quality","value":"5"},{"name":"Location","value":"5"},{"name":"Cleanliness","value":"5"},{"name":"Service","value":"4"}],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false}],"location":{"coordinates":[],"address":"El Melal Street Eel Garden, Assalah, Dahab 14611 Egypt"}},{"id":"17025133","type":"HOTEL","name":"Gina Motel Dahab","image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1c/c6/d6/23/img-20210318-145415-largejpg.jpg","awards":[],"rankingPosition":"26","priceLevel":"$","priceRange":"$19 - $28","category":"hotel","rating":5,"hotelClass":"0.0","phone":"+20 128 828 2017","email":"john_dahab@yahoo.com","amenities":[],"numberOfRooms":9,"prices":[],"webUrl":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297547-d17025133-Reviews-Gina_Motel_Dahab-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html","website":"https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Local-Service/Gina-Motel-Dahab-536276326743104/","rankingString":"#26 of 91 Specialty lodging in Dahab","rankingDenominator":"91","numberOfReviews":4,"reviews":[{"id":"785134114","lang":"en","location_id":"17025133","published_date":"2021-03-23T23:49:12-04:00","published_platform":"Mobile","rating":"5","type":"review","helpful_votes":"1","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297547-d17025133-r785134114-Gina_Motel_Dahab-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review785134114","travel_date":"2021-03","text":"Very clean bathroom and comfy beds, soap, towels, hot water, very near to the center, markets and at the same time in a quite street...

The architecture is really beautiful and the landscaped grounds. It has a huge pool which will soon be heated but was usable in March. The location is excellent as its on a sandy beach with all the watersports nearby and its own Padi diving centre.  You can also book trips to diving and snorkelling sites and St Catherines etc in the kiosk on the hotel beach where you will meet the very lovely Amany. \nIt's a  5 minute taxi ride to town where you can find lots of great little shops and restaurants.  Dahab is a laid back place where you will feel very safe  and you dont get more than a friendly approach from people who would like you to look in their shop or visit their restaurant.  Its very low hassle\n\nThe hotel breakfast had a vast choice and was delicious, the dinner was also very good. Only the buffet restaurant was open but they are opening more restaurants and a beautiful disco soon.  The prices for drinks and food are very reasonable compared to other hotels we have been to in Egypt. \n\nWe had a deluxe double room with the most comfortable bed I have every had in a hotel with lovely Egyptian cotton bedlinen . The shower was walk in and spotless and our room was kept beautiful every day by the wonderful Hesham who left us many fabulous towel art sculptures. \n\nAlthough its a beautiful hotel , the staff are what make it really great. I felt like they were like my Egyptian family by the end of our stay.  Too many to mention everyone but so many thanks to Sherin in reception, the Bell Captain Mr Ahmed, Mr Happy, Gamil , Ibrahim and all the dining room staff, Koka in the beach bar who was so friendly and delightful every day ( ask her for the special Koka Moka Mocktail) . Also to Shenoudah and Joseph in the bar , Mr Hany for so much help with room booking and other organisation, Guest Relations, especially the lovely Nesma and finally, my good friends Ibrahim, Neder and Mohamed who looked after us on the beach.  Thank you all for helping me with my Arabic lessons and being such lovely people. \n\nCannot recommend this hotel highly enough . ","title":"Can't wait to go back. Thoroughly recommended.

had actualy booked with another Camp which was a massive disappointment on so many levels. So we searched for an alternative and got the Crazy Camel Camp recommended by a friend. We arranged a meeting to see the rooms at night and were welcomed righ away. I immediately loved it, so we stayed the rest of our days in Dahab there. \n\nIt´s just lovely. The rooms are bright and very clean. As we stayed there with our dog, we especially loved the terrace and also the open yard, where our dog socialized with the resident dogs and lay in the sun. There are also multiple tables outside in sun or shade to sit and enjoy your time . If we ever needed anything there was always someone to ask. For example: as there were heavy rains the night we wanted t leave in the morning, our bus company told us that they would leave Dahab in the afternoon at 3pm. We asked if we could stay in the room a bit longer instead of checking out at 12, which would have been the rule and it was no problem at all.\n\nThe camp is perfectly located directly at the promenade. The first snorkel spot (getting in the water at the bridge) is just 3 minutes away. You cans stroll the promenade for food or find some cheaper options a bit away from the shore, nothing being far away. \n\nWe would always stay there again and highly recommend the place!","title":"Clean, bright, calm, friendly!","subratings":[{"name":"Sleep Quality","value":"4"},{"name":"Location","value":"5"},{"name":"Service","value":"5"}],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false},{"id":"753283475","lang":"en","location_id":"19838237","published_date":"2020-05-07T04:44:46-04:00","published_platform":"Desktop","rating":"4","type":"review","helpful_votes":"0","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297547-d19838237-r753283475-Crazy_Camel_Camp-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review753283475","travel_date":"2020-02","text":"We wre diving with Scuba Seekers, so it made sense to stay in the CCC as it is right next door.

The place has a new owner since around half a year, who improved the place a lot and made this one of the very best options to stay in Dahab! \nThe whole resort is beautifully designed in blue and white, has a perfect sitting area in the middle, and cozy rooms meeting everyone‘s needs. There are basic rooms for an unbeatable price (I couldn’t find any cheaper place to stay in the whole time), rooms with AC, group rooms- whatever you need. The toilets are in a good condition and there is hot water 24/7.\nThe best thing about Auski Camp is the amazing location. You‘re literally in the middle of Mashraba, and you have all the cheap good restaurants of Dahab just one walking minute away. Just outside, you find many shops, a liquor store, taxis, everything you need. I would say that you can’t find a better location in Dahab.\nThen, finally, the owner Karim and his worker, Mahmoud, are extremely kind and helpful people, who quickly became friends.\nIf you‘re searching for an amazing cheap place (also for long-term!), this is it!","title":"Excellent and cheap place to stay in Dahab!","subratings":[],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false},{"id":"782585811","lang":"en","location_id":"1492812","published_date":"2021-02-09T08:23:23-05:00","published_platform":"Desktop","rating":"1","type":"review","helpful_votes":"0","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297547-d1492812-r782585811-Auski_Camp-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review782585811","travel_date":"2021-02","text":"I usually do not write reviwes, but that experience was so bad, I just have to!\n\nI don´t even know where to start as we are still so perplexed by this extraordinarily bad experience!\n\nBefore the travel:\nWe were travelling with our dog, so we specifically looked for places that would allow a dog. Cuba Auski advertises on the internet with being pet friendly. Due to bad experiences before we still contacted them before booking, specifically mentioning the dog and asking for a good WiFi connection, as we had to do some work there. They said both was fine, so we booked a room with private bathroom, as we are not to keen on sharing bathrooms.\nA day before the trip I contacted the host to get a mobile number in case anything would go wrong. First thing I got was a text stating \"We have no room with private bathroom available\". After making very clear that we booked a private bathroom and expect one, the host eventually confirmed that we would get one.\n\nChecki-In:\nWhen we arrived, we were not put in a room in the Cuba Auski but in a neighbouring camp, which was fine with us, because it actually looked cleaner. Upon arrival they already informed us that we would only stay one day in this room and would have to move again, which we did not like to much but agreed to. However, suddenly our dog was a problem. She was not allowed in that room and they suggested she could just stay outside... with no fences at all and easy access to the street. What?! Of course we did not at all agree. As they did not offer any solution, we demanded our money back and wanted to search for another place. The host tried to trick us into cancelling the reservation on Airbnb, which due to the hosts chosen policy would have left us with no money at all (we had made exactly this experience before in Dahab!). He did not agree to repay usin cash. So they left us hanging there for a while until they managed to give us a room in the Cuba Auski Camp, which was not the room we booked. We figured out in the end that the host probably overbooked his place, asked a neighbouring host for help but did not mention the dog, which turned into a problem. He finally moved someone else out of Cuba Auski so we could get the room there. It seems not to be the first time the host overbooked, reading the reviews here.\n\nThe room:\nUnfortunately, the host did not take the time to clean the room (not that it would have helped a lot). The sheets were fresh, but that was about it. The room was crammed with three beds and barely enough space to even walk to the bathroom. The floor was not cleaned. There was only a single socket for a three-people-place! Not even enough to recharge everyones phone and for sure not enough to also work a little. The \"Workspace\" described in the amenities was not there (btw also no towels, toilet paper or soap, as state in the amenities). However, as there was also no functionable WiFi in the room (despite us asking before booking!), working would have been not possible anyways. The bathroom was beyond disgusting! Not only was it NOT cleaned and all the amatures where super rusty, but it also stank terribly. Unfortunately it was also not possible to close the bathroom door so the whole place stank like manure. B.t.w. there was also no handle on the front door, so when it fell shut we had to get help from outside to even leave the room.\n\nConclusion:\nWe hated every second there and moved out the next day, even without getting our money back. Please, even if you are financially tight, think about whether what you might save is really worth what you might get there! We ended up in Crazy Camel Camp which was amazing (!) and only few dollars more expensive per night and so worth it. Because, what good is a holiday if you hate being there?","title":"What an aweful

Those photos are part from the Bedouin Restaurant behind. The worst part about staying always here is the management. Always is empty, and when I am going to pay another night...\"sorry but we are full tomorrow, we have a reservation for this room you are staying\". It is very unreliable. At the time I stayed, they had a French guy doing a lousy job cleaning. Always the toilets and showers were filthy. The claim it WS because they were close to remodeling. I got a very serious burn with the shower. Someone flushed the toilet and the steam bent the PVC pipe in the shower splattering with burning water all my body. It used to be 25 £E per night now is way more. My room, 117 had a gap that I had to sleep with my winter clothes on. It was very cold at night, I would had bought a heater at local Gazala Supermarket, but they kicked me out anyway.","title":"Wiseguys","subratings":[{"name":"Rooms","value":"3"},{"name":"Value","value":"4"},{"name":"Sleep Quality","value":"1"},{"name":"Location","value":"3"},{"name":"Cleanliness","value":"1"},{"name":"Service","value":"3"}],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false}],"location":{"coordinates":["28.49188","34.51562"],"address":"3 Mashraba, G, Dahab 46617 Egypt"}}]
