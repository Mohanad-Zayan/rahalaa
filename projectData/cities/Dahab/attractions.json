I will say there's probably a better way than to pay a fair amount per person to get up their from Dahab . . .  especially since they often want to charge you extra for a wet suit (needed, just a shorts one), but they do provide snorkel mask and pipe. Some guides take you to better restaurants than others, as well. But the good news is no one's in a hurry.

It is not a long drive and we went with a local dive concern.\n\nThis was a bucket list dive for me and I was not disappointed.  We dove a route from El Bells to the Blue Hole and got to see the incredible wall between the two sites before entering in to the Blue Hole.  Access to the entry point at El Bells can be daunting if you are not physically strong or have week ankles as you need to get your kit up an incline and across uneven ground to get to the entry point. But don't worry about this as the dive concerns will arrange to get your kit there if it is an issue for you.\n\nThe entry to El Bells is awesome as it is like descending down an elevator shaft that is open towards the sea. The sea life is incredible, from the time you get in to the water until you climb out - it is teaming. You probably wont see much large sea life due to the fact that the locals are allowed to fish there, but the corals are alive with the smaller and medium fish.\n\nI did not find this a difficult dive but it does start off deep (33m) before you head off along the wall; so I would imagine that you can only do this dive as an advanced diver.\n\nBesides the diving there is an opportunity to see how the Bedouins live as there are bedoin cafes and homes right there.","publishedDate":"2022-11-15T03:32:28-05:00","rating":"5","travelDate":"2022-10","user":null,"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"Snorkeling, Scuba Diving","text":"Blue Hole is a perfect for Snorkeling and Scuba diving.

Once in the water we had a great time but unfortunately the beaches were covered in litter.\n\nIt’s great that eco-tourism is bringing work and money into the area but without sustainable practice this won’t be a reliable industry for future generations.\n\nI was also shocked to see so many children working - we were driven around by a boy that we were told was 10 years old (he was likely closer to 8 years of age).

Walking in to the center and you're greeted like old friends, making you feel instantly comfortable and a little less anxious. \n\nI went in for a Discover dive. The sign up process was super simple and quite quick. I appreciated the care and attention given. Vincent, the instructor, took the time to run through the medical form and address any questions and concerns I had. He provided a little mini briefing session the day before the dive to help prepare and set my expectations. \n\nThe day of the dive was also quick and effortless. Everything was ready to go when I arrived. I put the suit on and got in the water in less than 10 mins. I was a little stressed at first and was unsure but Vincent was very patient and took the time to understand my needs, staying close by and listening to my concerns. It wasn't long before I was able to relax and feel confident with all the gear, he was not overbearing and allowed me to explore and get one with the sea, staying close by. I felt extremely safe. \n\nThe dive itself was magical. I was mesmerized by all the fish and corals. Kudos to Vincent for also taking time to point out the life in the water. I would've surely missed the coolest creatures without him! This is my second time doing this type of dive. My first experience was quite traumatizing and I wanted to get over my fears.

I retook my open water PADI course after a 14 year break alongside my partner who had never dived. We enjoyed our experience so much that after finishing the open water at the lighthouse reef, we booked 3 fun dives and the advanced open water course to experience some of the other Dahab dive sites. Our instructor Yasser was very experienced, knowledgeable and really helped to settle my partner's nerves during our deeper dives at the Canyon and the El Bells to the Blue Hole drift dive. He had a great eye for spotting marine life we may have otherwise missed and took lots of photos and videos on his GoPro which he shared with us before we left. Highly recommend this dive centre for anyone visiting Dahab.","publishedDate":"2023-03-16T09:55:54-04:00","rating":"5","travelDate":"2023-03","user":null,"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"Great experience","text":"Super friendly staff and very quick to organise everything.

Quick response to all our questions before we signed up with them. They're flexible, honest and clear with their prices and expectations from your dives. Personally, it was my first time diving and to be honest I was very nervous about the hole thing, luckily I had THE BEST diver instructor: Yasser Mohamed, seriously I couldn't have asked for a better instructor. He has over 17 years experience, we did all the exercises until we master them, he didn't mind repeating the same thing until we did it right. He reassured me multiple times (as I was very nervous) and hold my hand on a couple of occasions to make me feel safer, which in all honesty it's what I needed to be able to relax and enjoy myself. Yasser genuinely is a nice person to be around; he loves diving, meeting new people and his enthusiasm is quite contagious. To the point where I not only finished my Open Water but went for the Advance and I'm very glad I did. Thanks to Big Blue Dahab and Yasser Mohamed for everything you have done for me; I'll never forget this experience and hopefully this won't be the last time we see each other.","publishedDate":"2023-03-11T05:58:32-05:00","rating":"5","travelDate":"2023-03","user":null,"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"PADI Open Water","text":"It was my pleasure doing the open water course in Big Blue Dahab with Captain Yasser Mohamed.

I am SO very lucky I listened to them and ended up finding a place I can only call a second home here in Dahab!\n\nAhmed, Soliman and the rest of the team at Bedouin divers are some of the most friendly and professional members of the dive community I have ever encountered. After diving with many dive schools across Asia, I can honestly say that the team at Bedouin have a managed to find a perfect balance of professionalism and organization mixed a laid back and very friendly atmosphere - you usually find one or the other but these guys have NAILED it. \n\nI was slightly unconfident when diving in the Red Sea for the first time (my first shore dive) but all of the dive guides were so gentle, informative and patient. I have been lucky enough to dive with Ahmed, Soliman, Rabea, Ata and Molo and it's safe to say that they know each and every dive site like the back of their hand. It's so important for me as a diver to find a school that uses local, knowledgeable guides who really care about the corals and marine life, you can sense all of their passion and love for the Red Sea on every single dive. \n\nI'd also like to draw attention to the dive community that Bedouin attracts in general. Ahmed and the team have managed to build up a great community through both returning and new divers. Fantastic conversation, many laughs and great buddies on every dive. \n\nThe team at Bedouin have transformed me from a nervous diver to someone who feels confident in the water and comfortable amongst other divers. \n\nThank you for transforming me as a diver Bedouin divers and thank you to Bedouin's four legged fluff ball Sina for many warm post dive cuddles.","publishedDate":"2023-02-15T07:36:06-05:00","rating":"5","travelDate":"2023-02","user":null,"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"Amazing diving experience","text":"My girlfriend and I came for 1 week to Dahab planning to only do the Open Water course, but after spending the first 3 days with Ahmed and the Bedouin Divers Team, we actually decided to stay for another 2 and do the Advanced course as well.\n\nAhmed and the Bedouin Divers Team are professional, thorough, pay a lot of attention to their students (above and below the water), and are very fun to be around.

Wahby was fun to deal with. Mahmoud and Sherin were excellent dive masters for our first dives in Dahab.\nAnwar (the diving instructor) went above and beyond my expectations. On top of his great teaching skills for PADI/SSI material and techniques, his overall demeanor was an huge plus.\nAs an instructor, he knows exactly when to stop, reiterate or come back later for a particular skill or a piece of information to ensure the message is delivered. His meticulous attention to my son's attention span and his ability to break down complex concepts in a way that was easy to understand was priceless. He was also great at answering all of our questions and ensuring that we are comfortable, safe, and confident in the water.\nI highly recommend Circle Divers Dahab as a diving center.

In one case, the course plan was modified significantly to accommodate my teenage daughter, who felt anxious about some of the drills. She ended up getting certified as a scuba diver instead of open water (which was the original plan), but the time that was saved by shortening the course was used to do three fun dives that made her much more comfortable in the water. This plan modification was initiated by the team because they were concerned that continuing the open water course would cause her to give up on scuba diving. I was very impressed by the dedication, friendliness, and professionalism of the team - much more so than I have experienced in other dive clubs.

Very approachable, helpful, supportive, knowledgeable of the local diving sites (and various others around the Red Sea), all extremely patient, courteous and great listeners and observers.

I dived with Elodie, Gerard, Ihmad, Hamada and Tariq and enjoyed all of their company, camaraderie and professional direction.  At the end of my 12 dives, I was well entrenched into their super friendly dive family.  Every single one were always concerned to ensure that I had enjoyed my experiences and dives with them.  I cannot fault this team.  And I only wish I could transport them to other areas around the world where the approach has distance and 'just another day and another load of divers'.

We dived for over a week, did shore dives, boat dives at Gabr-el-Bint, and night dive at the Lighthouse reef in Dahab, and of course - the Blue Hole and the Canyon. The marine life is incredible, healthy reefs, the underwater photographer's paradise. Red Sea is the top world's dive destination, and you can see why in Dahab.

After talking to Renate on the first day (we only pre-booked the OWD course upfront), she talked us out of it and encouraged us to do the OWD and then get some experience after. \n\nWe totally underestimated the extensiveness of the OWD course (I started it some years ago in LATAM and did the theory + confined in two days), and it took us 4.5 days to get done with everything. Renate took great care of us and mixed theory and the confined dives in a very thoughtful matter.

Having dived in various spots with various centers I can undoubtedly say blackrock is the best center I have dived with in Egypt due to, not only quality and reliability, but also precision and commitment to educate, entertain and maintain the safety of their guests.\nAs for my open water course, i have learned, understood and practically applied all the skills, concepts and requirements in the official PADI book. They were so informative and sufficiently explanatory that I could easily apply and discuss all of them having known them by heart. Mamdouh our instructor deserves a great thank you for literally being the most attentive, knowledgeable and fun instructor someone can look for.\nHe made sure to explain, discuss, repeat, display and evaluate all the the required skills in addition to being open for all our questions.\nLast but not least, Renate, the general manager, YOU ARE AWESOME....Thank you for being a great friend, a great diver and for keeping this place as professional as it is.

I took my wife and children (aged 16 & 14) to the Sinai to recuperate after a family bereavement. We couldn't have been in better hands. \n\nThe kids and I took the Open Water Diving course and we are now PADI qualified to dive to a depth of 18 metres. Under the expert tuition of PADI-registered instructor Mamdou, all three of us spent four busy days getting to grips with the stuff of Scuba Diving. I had not considered it deeply but, on reflection, I should have realised this would be a physical holiday. If you want to relax on the beach all day, or lay-in of a morning in your hotel bed, this course won't be for you. However, if discovering an undersea kingdom in one of the World's prime diving locations appeals to you, Black Rock will sort you out.\n \nAs a parent, safety was my first priority. Mamdou was meticulos in his care of us and Black Rock Director Renate's set up involves high-quality kit and well-organised systems. Base-camp, the Dive Centre, is comfortable and spacious. The well-ventilated classroom works and access to the sea is very close.\n \nThere are other Dive Centres in Dahab. Happily we found Black Rock on our first family Sinai trip. There are also other diving spots in the World. I'm pleased. It's a wonderful sport. However, we won't be going anywhere else in a hurry. My kids and I will be going back to Dahab and we'll be diving with Black Rock. Why wouldn't we? I think it was as good as it gets.

They did not only provide decent courses (my brother did OW and AOW, I did deep dive specialty), the dive center was also our home-away-from-home for about 10 days. The staff is very friendly and went out of their way to assist us. It felt like a family we were lucky to be part of for a little while. It's not surprising that many of the students/staff stayed here longer than initially planned. The chill, low-key vibe in Dahab adds to that. The dive center is located central on the strip with chill bars and restaurants along the waterfront (e.g., Yalla), and has two dive sites just in front with plenty of corals and marine life to discover. There's also the opportunity to arrange multiple dive trips (e.g., blue hole, abu galum) through the center. We stayed at the hotel which was related to the dive center (red sea relax resort), which was very convenient. The hotel also has a beautiful garden and pool, great to take a nap after a day of diving.","publishedDate":"2022-06-02T05:09:46-04:00","rating":"5","travelDate":"2022-05","user":null,"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"Best diving center in Dahab ","text":"The best diving center in Dahab.

So I was a bit nervous and just wanted to have a refresher dive. The guys at Poseidon hooked me up with an instructor and all the gear. I was given a recap of all the equipment I got kitted out in a short wetsuit, shoes, flippers, mask, oxygen etc\nI was given some instruction about the gear, including inflating and deflating the jacket to make you sink and rise. I tested my oxygen via the mouthpiece a few times and did the same for my emergency one. Finally, everything seemed to be in order, and a large trolly on wheels arrived, pulled by the staff. We loaded all the dive gear on, and off we went.\nWe quickly reached the shore of the Red Sea at a safe dive entry point, waded out in the calm water, and got to just over waist height. A few words from the instructor guided me to try all the gear underwater but at a very shallow depth, and then down we go. We started to swim while dropping in depth considerably. Before I knew it, I must be 6 meters down, which seemed pretty deep. I had the instructor in my field of vision the whole time, and on the way down, he kept checking if I was Ok using the international diving sign of joining the tip of your index finger with your thumb. A-OK\nWhilst I was nervous as I hadn’t been at that depth since the barrier reef, I was reassured by my instructor, who made me feel safe; we got to around 12 meters in total which felt deep.\nI saw sea anemone with their clown fish residents, lionfish with their poisonous fins, there were large parrot fish and corals of every colour; it was mind-blowing. I loved it so much that I booked another dive with Poseidon.\nThe second day was probably the best dive experience I have ever had. I was very relaxed with my instructor and enjoyed every minute of it. The reef was beautiful and I can’t wait to do it again!","publishedDate":"2022-08-19T04:54:59-04:00","rating":"5","travelDate":"2022-08","user":null,"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"The best diving center in Dahab","text":"I had some of the best divings ever.

First of all, I am sure we can agree that the first impression counts, and at Poseidon that was the case. When I arrived at Poseidon, Shahad the Manager was very friendly and welcoming. I noticed at once how well organized, neat, and tidy the dive base is. Furthermore, the communication about the dive schedule was impeccable. We exchanged what's app numbers and Shahad responded always immediately, easy and uncomplicated.\nSecondly, in my point of view,  customer service is extremely important. I told Shahad what I am interested in and what I would like to do (slow dives and taking pictures at Lighthouse) and he did organize a very experienced dive guide for me. Mamdo is the best!!! He has such good knowledge and knows every dive side by heart. He is serious about the diving rules but also entertaining. Diving with him is so much fun! I specifically was looking for seahorses and he would find two for me in an area where no other divers would be. Just awesome. I also had a wonderful night dive with him.\nSo to sum up my review, if you're looking for a good dive experience with a reliable dive center then choose Poseidon.\nBig thanks again to Shahad and Mamdo🤗🙏🙏 can't wait to be back...\n\n","publishedDate":"2021-01-05T01:09:22-05:00","rating":"5","travelDate":"2020-12","user":null,"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"wonderful !","text":"great team, great instructor, great environnement... great friends. there's one and only place you want to learn scuba diving in Egypt, that's here ! thx again you all !!","publishedDate":"2020-02-27T00:28:29-05:00","rating":"5","travelDate":"2020-02","user":null,"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"They were great 🐢 🐠","text":"I stayed at blue beach hotel and partook in two days of diving with Posideon Divers which were some of the best dives I’ve done.

I have my AOW but it’s been three years since my last dive. I brought my friend who wanted to give the whole diving thing a go (after years of nagging on my part!) \nWalked past a few dive centres who were not particularly welcoming. When we stumbled upon Desert Divers we were greeted by Osama who instantly started to make us feel like family. \nWe started our dives with Mohsen. I need to write a novel to explain all the ways in which he is the best diving instructor to grace the ocean. \nHe took my best mate from a nervous try dive through to her open water and finishing with a dive in the Blue Hole. \nAnd me, he took from a nervous diver and reshaped me into a confident diver who trusts herself and her skills and can now confidently be in the ocean. I regularly felt like I was a fish. \nHonestly, words are not enough to explain the ways in which all of you have made the both of us feel over the past week. We have loved everything you have done for us, from scuba diving, to making us tea to making us feel like a part of your lovely diving family. \nAnd it’s safe to say we will be back. Stella will come for her AOW and me for my Rescue. And if Mohsen will put up with me long enough I’ll let him make me a dive master. \nIf you want him to he can make anybody a diver and will do so whilst making you laugh. But don’t mess him about 😂\n\nSeriously: anybody contemplating where to dive in Dahab- do yourselves a massive favour and look no further.

I had problems equalising on the open water session, and was given some very good exercises and the tip to watch Aharon Solomons' video on Frenzel equalisation, which helped me to pass the course.

Don’t miss it!!!  Bakher is in charge.   English speaking, quick responses to planning questions by whatsapp.  So helpful with everything I needed to know.  We crossed border from Israel to Taba.  He arranged for a driver to be waiting for us and we had an uneventful 1.5 hour ride through some striking desert scenery.  He recommended the Swiss Inn and I strongly recommend it as well.  Comfortable, clean, big pool, well maintained grounds and right on beach.   (If you like leaving porch door open, ask for a room on second floor!)  Most importantly, all of a 2 minute walk to dive shop from your room.  From the dive shop to water is maybe 25 meters.  The other dive shops are on the main strip area, so not as convenient and you can't really go in from shore.\nBubbles team is just as outstanding.  Helpful in every way.  Our divemaster, Ameen, was incredible (but I’m told they all are).  Meticulously safety conscious and very knowledgeable.  They are a full service PADI dive site offering just about every level of classes.  For me, I just wanted to dive.  Almost every site is a shore dive but there are boat trips as well.  I started with a test, some review and jumped in for a refresher dive.  (so long since my last dive-damn covid!!!)  I didn’t have an agenda so just went with the flow and every place we went was amazing.  My max depth was 30 meters, but along the reefs, I didn’t feel a need to go deeper.  Don’t miss the blue hole.  If you take pictures, you’ll want your camera.  If you have a partner who doesn’t dive, there is snorkeling. \nWe went in February which is off season.  Days were sunny and 60(F) with a strong wind, so bring a warm up.  Definitely need a wet suit.  But, such a joy to have virtually no crowds.  \nEven with tip, everything was totally affordable.  \nBubbles (and Swiss Inn) are a winning combination that you will totally love!!!","publishedDate":"2023-02-15T04:52:07-05:00","rating":"5","travelDate":"2023-02","user":null,"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"Bubbles diving team","text":"Such an astonishing experience 💪🏻💪🏻\n Thank you bubbles team\n❤️\n.Thanks coach bakr and moustafa❤️❤️\nWill come back for sure🧜‍♀️🧜‍♀️","publishedDate":"2023-01-28T05:14:58-05:00","rating":"5","travelDate":"2023-01","user":null,"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"Perfect","text":"The best place in all dahab  , highly recommended - recommended for diving classes       Minna khaled ………..","publishedDate":"2023-01-28T04:35:18-05:00","rating":"5","travelDate":"2023-01","user":null,"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"Awesome crew, great experience","text":"Bubbles team was recommended to me by a friend.

This review focuses now on my 2nd visit (I conducted the AIDA 3 course).\n\nBooking:\n-Very friendly and efficient\n-Few mails and course, accommodation and transfer was booked\n-Very quick response time\n-I especially liked the „looking forward to have you“ mail a few days before my trip started\n\nArrival:\n-Pick-up was organized and all went well \n\nDive center & infrastructure:\n-Open from 9am-530pm and a good place to hang-out\n-Always somebody around for a nice chat (in any given language)\n-The center is attached to the hotel in which I stayed\n-The ocean is like a 10 step walk and with a short swim you can dive to >40m\n-The blue hole is a short ride with the cab (I did not go this time)\n-We went also for a 2 hour session to a 30m pool facility to practice „dynamic“ -> This was probably one of the two highlights of my course. Having the pool just for us (Trainer and myself) I could focus on improving my skills and felt like a pro sportsman \n\nAida 3 course -:\n-I requested to take the course with the same instructor (Stephano) as I liked him and his way of teaching already in Aida 2\n-They could not promise (obviously due to work schedules etc.) however they made it happened and I took the course also with Stephano\n-I appreciate that the diver center made the effort to realize my wish\n-If you want to learn freediving or need coaching I can only recommend Stephano\n-There is nothing I could recommend him to improve in his teaching. He is a very calm Swiss which is able to explain the „complex topics from the textbook and slides“ in simple terms. He is a great coach supporting you to become (more) self aware. He is dedicated to safety and a great communicator. -> He was my second highlight of the course \n-If I do Aida 4 I would explicitly request Stephano again \n\nAccommodation:\n-This time I stayed directly at the dive center in their partner hotel „red sea relax“\n-Hotel has a close proximity to the center (attached to it)\n-Staff was very friendly, breakfast was good, daily room cleaning (they forgot on first day but was not an issue at all -> Maybe they thought I sleep in due to late arrival)\n-Improvement area 1: The internet is a difficult topic, it is rather slow and you are busy logging into different repeaters all the time\n-> However, quite good internet at the dive center\n-Improvement area 2: The room is functional but don’t expect something fancy.

The quality of this is very important for the whole team.

The rental equipment was all very well maintained and provided comfortable diving. The quality of dive training was professional yet fun and made me feel very confident.\n A huge bonus of the dive centre was the on-site Open Ocean Science Centre where there were superb scientific lab facilities and numerous marine biologists carrying out various projects, all who are willing to answer any questions about the reef! Also the dive centre was very environmentally aware, with mandatory try dives to protect corals and recycling bins on site which is particularly important in Dahab.\nI highly recommend this dive centre to anyone looking for a well organised, relaxed and very good value for money diving experience in a beautiful location. Or for any scientists looking for a well equipped base for any coral reef research.\nRun with true German efficiency and with friendly, welcoming staff with a wealth of knowledge and experience. I consider this dive centre a home away from home and will definitely return here for future diving trips and scientific research, 10/10!","publishedDate":"2014-09-27T05:34:23-04:00","rating":"5","travelDate":"2014-08","user":null,"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false}],"location":{"coordiantes":["28.490358","34.514812"],"address":"Mashraba Jowhara Hotel, Dahab 069 Egypt"},"activities":["Tours","Boat Tours & Water Sports","Outdoor Activities"],"activityDesctiptor":["Scuba & Snorkeling"]},{"type":"ATTRACTION","image":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/33/96/2c/dahab-divers-lodge.jpg","location_id":"3573174","name":"Dahab Divers Lodge","num_reviews":"93","timezone":"Africa/Cairo","location_string":"Dahab, South Sinai, Red Sea and Sinai","photo":{"images":{"small":{"width":"150","url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/03/33/96/2c/dahab-divers-lodge.jpg","height":"150"},"thumbnail":{"width":"50","url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/03/33/96/2c/dahab-divers-lodge.jpg","height":"50"},"original":{"width":"550","url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/33/96/2c/dahab-divers-lodge.jpg","height":"364"},"large":{"width":"550","url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/33/96/2c/dahab-divers-lodge.jpg","height":"364"},"medium":{"width":"550","url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/33/96/2c/dahab-divers-lodge.jpg","height":"364"}},"is_blessed":true,"uploaded_date":"2012-12-12T05:16:15-0500","caption":"Dahab","id":"53712428","helpful_votes":"3","published_date":"2012-12-12T05:18:21-0500","user":{"user_id":null,"member_id":"0","type":"user"}},"api_detail_url":"https://api.tripadvisor.com/api/internal/1.14/location/3573174","awards":[],"location_subtype":"tour_operator","doubleclick_zone":"af.egypt.red_sea_and_sinai.south_sinai.dahab","preferred_map_engine":"default","raw_ranking":"3.602323532104492","ranking_geo":"Dahab","ranking_geo_id":"297547","ranking_position":"36","ranking_denominator":"98","ranking_category":"attraction","ranking_subcategory":"#36 of 98 Boat Tours & Water Sports in Dahab","subcategory_ranking":"#36 of 98 Boat Tours & Water Sports in Dahab","ranking":"#36 of 98 Boat Tours & Water Sports in Dahab","distance":null,"distance_string":null,"bearing":null,"rating":"5.0","is_closed":false,"is_long_closed":false,"description":"Dahab Divers Lodge is a PADI Five Star Dive Resort with a home atmosphere combined with quality, experience and passion for diving.

Amazing!\nClimbed some rocks to see the view, passed through some canions, had a coffee on the campfire, did sandboarding also, and finished with the lunch with shisha.\nNext day I got cool photos and videos!\n\nWhat I want to say here:\n\n1. Ashraf is not like a typical guide making standard trips for a crowd. No. He will ask what you want and will do exactly what you want. It worth the money 200%.  \nHe lives in Dahab for more than 20 years, knows very special places including geological formations 3 days far away from Dahab (lucky you if you are a geologist), knows some religious places, can make a real tour to White and Black deserts as well (a real tour, no 20 meters from the main road). He is a professional.\n\n2. He is reliable, always on time, if he says 4:00 am in the morning, it will be 4 am exactly. No \"Inshalla\", no \"arabic time\", nothing like that. He says - he does. Very rare quality I should say.\n\n3. He does more than it was planned to make people happy. In my case I expected it to be like 2 canions, but we had time for 3 canions (even I was too tired to climb on top of the last one), sandboarding, 1 viewpoint and coffee and lunch. It's like everything in one day!\n\nMy best recommendations to Ashraf, and I will come back for the next trip. Now I know with whom to go to the Black and White deserts.","publishedDate":"2022-06-09T04:43:45-04:00","rating":"5","travelDate":"2022-05","user":null,"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"Desert bedouin dinner","text":"I spent an evening at the desert with Ashraf...

Our group was primarily there to dive, but I was interested in horseback riding. \nThe guide from Mona Lisa Stable met me at the dive site with horses and we rode out from there. He was flexible about the timeline, and we ended up riding just past Gabr el Bint (3 hours roundtrip with a solid amount of galloping). My guide was incredibly kind, thoughtful, and happy to discuss the horse culture in Egypt (e.g. nutrition, stable management, etc). We galloped in areas where the footing allowed and he even offered to film video. I'd guess that he would be just as willing to provide a shorter and/or more leisurely ride for novice equestrians or those just looking to experience such wonderous scenery from horseback. I highly recommend this stable! The animals are well cared for (healthy weight, feet, grooming), the guide is thoughtful and friendly, and the price is very fair. I wouldn't have ridden with this stable if the animals were not correctly cared for. This stable came recommended by local ex-pats and I'm glad to have followed their advice. I'll always remember riding with MLS as the highlight of my week-long trip to Dahab!\nAt the dive site our group had our own cabana area right on the water where we could safely leave our items. The hosts offered food and drink that was very satisfactory for our hungry divers.

My only regret was not having one of my regular UW photographic buddies with me as we would have dived at a much slower pace.\n\nOne thing to note is that Nitrox is not regularly supplied here and the Divers House do not have a Nitrox analyser. Nitrox can be supplied but they will also have to borrow an analyser. Therefore if planning to use Nitrox, bring your own analyser.\n\nThere is a great camaraderie with Jasmine their neighbours and we were well supplied with tea and coffee whenever we needed it.\n\nBig shout out to Tamer who manages the place and the other staff who took care of tank fills, loading the pick-up and driving us to the various sites.","publishedDate":"2021-08-01T04:07:43-04:00","rating":"4","travelDate":"2021-07","user":null,"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"Awesome place","text":"Took my open water course there with Hussam.. he was an excellent instructor, Tamer was very helpful! & extremely professional the Diver’s House is definetly recomended \n\nIt was a great experience and hope to go back soon.","publishedDate":"2021-07-06T15:40:43-04:00","rating":"5","travelDate":"2020-08","user":null,"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"en","title":"Great experience","text":"I took my open water course at Divers House.

Мы заранее связались с ребятами. Мы созвонились и нам все все все рассказали, и подготовили к серьезному отношению к обучению, так как наша цель была, научиться и получить самый первый сертификат умения дайвингу, после курса мы поняли, что не будем останавливаться и по возможности будем стараться продвигаться дальше в познании подводного мира под руководством Александра! Благодаря, великолепной системе обучения, мы из «думающих, что умеем опускаться под воду с аквалангом», действительно стали начинающими дайверами. Техничный и спокойный стиль инструктажа вызывает доверие и уважение. Поначалу мы, наверное, как и все новички, паниковали при выполнении упражнений, но Александр сказал, что пока всему не научимся дальше подвигаться не будем, потому что безопасность превыше всего. Хочу отметить, спокойная реакция Александра давала нам возможность успокоиться и понять что все под контролем, а позже мы и сами хотели перевыполнить упражнения на пять баллов. Обучение очень понятное и грамотно распланировано,все внештатные ситуации были разобраны и сымитированы под водой, недалеко от берега, после чего, мы уже вообще не боялись ничего. Вообще, слов благодарности и их последовательности, конечно же не хватает. Александр спокойный, техничный профессионал, уверены, что все последующие дайвы, мы теперь только в школу к «ластоногим». Ребята умеют заразить любовью к подводной жизни и тому куда можно двигаться дальше. Огромное спасибо за индивидуальный подход и действительно так и есть «очень много практики». За наш непродолжительный отпуск мы, действительно зарядились красотой подводного мира, а потом получили прекрасные фотографии и видео погружения, как приятный бонус на память.","publishedDate":"2023-01-08T01:10:11-05:00","rating":"5","travelDate":"2023-01","user":null,"subratings":[],"machineTranslated":false},{"language":"ru","title":"Рекомендасьон!","text":"Повезло учится у Александра!

We were told that entrance fee to Blue Lagoon is included in the trip, yet we had to argue at the entrance to the site that we already paid it because King Safari Dahab didn't inform trip organiser\n\n2. We were promissed to have a lunch on the trip (Egyptian chicken, etc.). It turned out that the trip organizer also wasn't informed that we booked a lunch. We ended up without it. While we only wanted 80 EGP per person refund (the cheapest chicken meal in menu - see picture) King Safari offered us 50 EGP per person, arguing that \"this is what meal costs them\". \n\nI am happy guys that you only pay 50 EGP but we had to pay more. If you negotiated with a trip organizer that transportation is, say, cost of 200 EGP and lunch (as part of this negotiation discount) is only 20 EGP would you only refund us 20 arguing that it is \"your cost\"?\n\nLong story short we had to pay for their mistake. Not recommended.\n\nFYI my snorkel mask was leaking and my partner had broken snorkel tube but we do not include it as a part of rating because you most likely won't find a better equipment in any other office.

If you would like to eat your dinner in an alternative location or go on one of our desert safaris we'd be happy to speak to you about your requirements. We look forward to providing you with a traditional Bedouin dinner and a memorable evening!

We invite you to discover the treasures of true deserts, surrounded by the stunningly azure-blue Red sea. The blue color of our special sea is caused by the combination of iron in our sands with salt in the sea. \n\nAbout Sinai:\n-----------------\nSinai is located between the Gulf of Aqaba, the Suez canal and the Mediterranean Sea. The Sinai peninsula is approximately 380 kilometers long between the North and South coasts and 220 kilometers from West to East. There are 22 different Bedouin tribes living here. They are natives to this land for centuries.\n\nAbout Dahab:\n-------------------\nDahab is located on the Red Sea between Sharm-el-Sheikh to the South and Nuweiba to the North. Dahab is one of the most attractive beach resorts in South Sinai, Egypt. Its sea shore is covered with fine golden sand that might have given Dahab its Arabic name, \"Gold\".\nDahab is a real paradise for diving and snorkeling thanks to amazing underwater landscapes of the Red Sea. Dahab is also a well-known spot for kite- and windsurfing because it is located in the wind tunnel of the Gulf of Aqaba. \n\nPlease feel welcome to join us in Sinai on a desert safari. 'Sinai Bedouin safari' offers trekking and camel trips around the scenic desert, 4x4 jeep safari, backpacking, the unique experience of a Bedouin dinner in the mountains, and rock climbing, to name a few of our activities- all led under the watchful eye.
