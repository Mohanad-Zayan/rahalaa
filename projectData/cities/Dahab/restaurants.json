But with each visit, things became worse and worse, with the only difference being Paola's absence and Ramez's (prominent) presence. During our most recent (and likely, last) visit, the other week, Ramez was drunk and so rude with customers and staff that I was left with a bad feeling for several days (specifically after seeing him give his chef the middle finger and insulting him in other obscene ways). We were there the same night as the two previous reviews and can confirm what they say. Ramez is prone to kicking you out if you drink your own bottle of water or have the audacity to sit at a table that disagrees with his business sense. The food is a lot more expensive than in other pizza/pasta places in Dahab and the quality (of the food and the service) is inconsistent at best.

excellent, pasta is top (I warmly suggest to get ragù bolognese) and pizza is amazing...better than many others tried in Italy. \nIt is worthy to go there also for the very good rate quality/price.

The location can be easily reached by taxi and yet it's completely private, away from the regular tourism spots. One of the few authentic places left, if you're lucky you might even get to listen or join an Egyptian jam session as the owners Dad loves playing Oud. The slow-cooked food is absolutely outstanding even for vegetarians like me - no matter whether you're a meat lover or vegan, you'll leave more than satisfied. Finally some different and home-cooked food options than in all the other restaurants. Clean bathrooms as well, which is rare here!

Let me explain, the guy pulled out raw chicken from under the counter (I'm praying from a fridge!) then proceeded to chop up what looked like little pieces of gristle... He threw it all in to a hot plate to cook and without washing his hands from the raw chicken decided to handle the bread roll! \n\nAs for the seating, if you like eating in a dirty street surrounded by pick up trucks then go for it!\n\nI tried the chicken fajita filling and it was tasteless , the whole thing went in the bin!!\n\nI will not be returning...","user":null,"title":"Just be careful...","owner_response":null,"subratings":[],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false},{"id":"302246443","lang":"en","location_id":"3739157","published_date":"2015-08-22T12:29:23-04:00","published_platform":"Mobile","rating":"5","type":"review","helpful_votes":"0","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297547-d3739157-r302246443-Popeye_Sandwich-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review302246443","travel_date":"2015-08","text":"Cheapest restaurant in dahab still the most delicious....

As for the food it was extremely tasty, i didnt taste this taste even in the fanciest and overpriced restaurants in Cairo. The taste of the food remebered me of Paris pastries for real. The food is so tasty, very well coooked and presented and the portions are so big and u cannot complete a whole plate.

We shared a plate of oyster, fish, calmari and shrimps.\nHe brought us the fish without weighing it in front of us. We also agreed that the calamari, shrimps, oyster should be 1/2 a kilo.\nThe fish we got is different than the one we chose in terms of size, and the calmari, shrimps and oyster is much less than the expected.\nWe ended up paying 2000 LE and this is too much with respect to the food eaten as well as the quality itself.\nWhen we talked with the manager, he said he can deduct 85 off the total, but this is nothing for us..we expected to pay 1200 maximum but not that much.\nI don’t recommend it at all.

They told us we ordered beer when we didn’t drink any alcohol loll. They added a guacamole charge on our nachos when we didn’t order it with our nachos, AND it didn’t even come with the guacamole😂😂. The salsa instructor is very aggressive and was screaming out things to his friends in whatever language he was speaking (most likely cussing out the people he was teaching because none of us knew salsa and he seemed so angry).

To be fair he was polite and eager to please when needed.\n\n2- Food: missing ALOT of spices that actually is the essence of Mexican food.

Adult mains (2 kinds of chicken enchiladas and chicken tacos) were just awful and took over an hour to arrive. Dry, bland despite being beautifully presented. We couldn't even finish half, just left the whole thing on the plate and none of the staff cared. Chicken fajitas were fairly good, pico de gallo was fresh.

So, I'm glad to see it's finally on here because it's worth the good publicity. Here is my original review:\n\nAs their first-ever customers, my husband and I feel compelled to review (Where You Wanna Go?) I Don't Care, not out of a sense of obligation but because this place deserves to do well and should be shared amongst the TripAdvisor community. We ate here on our last two nights in Dahab, and we enjoyed every minute of it. \n\nFrom the street view, it looks a little expensive because of it's unique, modern decor: the seating is made up of comfortable sofas with warm lighting, and it is impeccably clean. Once you have a look at their menu, though, you'll discover their pricing is fair and comparable to its neighbours.\n\nAnd it's well worth it because their food is excellent and unlike any other restaurant we tried. The first night we shared their warm, handmade bread, fresh juice, tasty Greek salad, steak grilled to perfection and handmade pasta. We were fully sated and satisfied. On our last night in Dahab, we sampled their salami pizza (baked in a proper Italian oven!) and deliciously fragrant beef tagine. Perfect! The portions were too large for us to attempt dessert, but the Italian-trained chef assured us they're scrumptious. We wish we had had one more day to try his lasagne. \n\nThe restaurant does not serve alcohol, but they will gladly go to the shop to buy whatever it is you desire. We also saw other customers order shisha.\n\nWhat made it for my husband and I was the attentive, friendly and timely service. In a market that's desperately vying for patrons, we felt absolutely no pressure and hassle for our custom. It was a truly pleasurable dining experience from start to finish. We wish them every success because they certainly deserve it!","user":null,"title":"First customers who'd love to

After my swim there is always Lemon juice.\nOne of the days at lunch two beautifully freshly caught fish were prepared for friends and I and they were really delicious. \nThe place is kept, clean and spotless. and it has a lot of seating, long chairs with parasols from the sun.\nNear by you can rent snorket gear and fins if you forgot. If after swimming you want to rinse of the salt water there is a place to take a hot shower. \nI always left my personal belongs on the chairs while I swam and felt safe. \nGreat place to come on your own, or with freinds or a romantic gateaway.\nIf you need advise, or idea for evenings ask Sultan he will come up with something great for everyone.\nAhmed was also really great and helpful.\nCheck it out and enjoy a day at the beach at the Light House at Shells.","user":null,"title":"Great location Great Service by Sultan and Fresh Fish","owner_response":null,"subratings":[],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false},{"id":"622148839","lang":"en","location_id":"4413097","published_date":"2018-10-04T07:19:01-04:00","published_platform":"Desktop","rating":"4","type":"review","helpful_votes":"0","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297547-d4413097-r622148839-Shells-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review622148839","travel_date":"2018-09","text":"In the more quiet end of the boardwalk.

They still have a good spot though since it is in the Lighthouse. But i think it is not worth going there anymore.  Even their coffee taste became inconsistent.

Shanti Cafe was so inviting. The exterior is painted with bright happy colors and really has a beach feel. Entering you are immersed in a bohemian coffee shop vibe, the ceiling draped with beautiful live plants and a friendly pup greeting you at the door. Food was really fresh, lots of vegan and vegetarian options. Excellent flavors and great variety. We enjoyed quinoa avocado salads and fresh pressed juice for lunch and returned for dinner because everything has just smelled so good. My sister had the Pasta Bolognese and I had the seafood like rice ... both delicious and again made to order. Ended the night with a vegan chocolate honey cake, cappuccino and camomile / lemon grass tea. I enjoyed it all so much that I returned for breakfast the next day and had pancakes draped in fresh strawberries and honey.

almost two years, I came back again. The design of the place is different, the ownership has changed, but the management, the atmosphere and the taste have remained the same - excellent.\nI visited and ate at the place at different times of the day and night, tasted seafood and meat. No need to elaborate as everything was very tasty, beautifully served with great service and wonderful attitude.\nThis is not a Michelin restaurant in Paris but it is without a doubt a perfect restaurant for lunch or dinner with excellent food served beautifully and very tasty, and the price? Fair and even cheap.\nIf you are in Dahab do not miss.\nthank you hissam :)","user":null,"title":"one again -

The service was great, and yes the location is gorgeous, but that was the best thing about the meal. We had calamari to start, and it was really chewy. For the main course I had vegetable tajine.

The location is great, a nice change from the crowded cafes by the sea.The restaurant is also very cosy, with the quieter space upstairs. We sat downstairs twice, and upstairs when it was too hot and we needed some good AC. I know it also offers good wifi but we didn't try to be honest. Also, if you love dogs, Patrick has 3 lovely dogs just lounging about.\n\nI 100% recommend this place for a tasty, clean & fresh breakfast and really good coffee too!

Now it’s sinai but it’s February so it’s  winter and it’s cold. My phone lives on to tell this story.

приятное место. Дружелюбный персонал. Вкусная еда. Уютные столики.\nПрогуливаясь по набережной Дахаба, захотели окунуться на Лайтхаусе. Вся первая линия довольно плотно заставлена кафешками, с лежаками или просто со столиками. Конечно можно зайти в воду и в узеньких промежутках между кафуриками, но тогда вещи останутся без присмотра и есть вероятность остаться после плавания без них. Поэтому мы решили заходить в море через кафе. Оказалось, что для того, чтобы это сделать, нужно заплатить 100-150 фунтов, заказать чего-то как минимум на эту сумму, что даст возможность пользоваться лежаком хоть весь день. Но поскольку нас было трое, мы были неголодны и хотели всего лишь окунуться, будучи уверенными в сохранности вещей, ну и может полчасика потом полежать, и идти гулять дальше, нам показалось, что 20-30$ дороговатая цена. Такие условия оказались на всем пути от Иль гардена в сторону моста. И первая кафешка, которая предложила нам плавать, загорать, отдыхать без привязки к сумме минимального чека на человека - Blue House. Мы воспользовались этим предложением и потом не раз возвращались сюда и ещё вернёмся в будущем 🥰. Очень приятный персонал. Уютные столики: обычные высокие или низкие с возможностью полежать, позагорать.  Подзарядка гаджетов. Хороший вход в моря, прямо напротив которого мы встретили черепах 🤩 Ну и вкусная еда. Всем рекомендую, отличное уютное место с очень приятным хозяином Зизо.","user":null,"title":"Классная

Me and my wife we ordered latte, Turkish coffee with milk, cheese cake and lazy cake.

We spoke to the manager , we returned back the coffe and we ordered lemon juice instead. The juice was good . Surprisingly, once we get the bill we come to know that they have charged us for the coffe and latte , we spoke to the manger and he responded in a careless , unprofessional way that he never received any kind of complains before , and basses on the reviews their standard is unquestionable,he insisted to charge us for the stuff that we didn’t drink. We paid the full amount with complementary tips for the staff and we will never go there again.\nمررنا بتجربة سيئة للغاية في Everyday Cafe Dahab. طلبت انا و زوجتي لاتيه و قهوة باللبن ، تشيز كيك ، ليزي كيك. القهوة كانت وحشة جدا هي و اللاتيه ناديت علي الويتر و بلغته كان رده انه هينده المدير محدش جه روحت للمدير و قلتله القهوة وحشة جدا  ، اصر ان القهوة كويسة ، طلبت منه يدوقها و قالي كويسة!! الكيك كان وحش جدا و قديم ، الليزي كيك جه متاخر و كان وحش جدا ، طلبت عصير الليمون بدل القهوة كان حلو جدا. لما جه الحساب اتفاجات انه هايحاسبني علي القهوة و اللاتيه اللي مشربتهمش و كان رده ان التقييمات بتاعته كويسه جدا و ان الاستاندرد بتاعه عالي و انه بيجيله اجانب كتير و محدش بيشتكي. حاسبت علي المبلغ بالكامل و سيبت تيبس للستاف و عمري مهروح هناك تاني.","user":null,"title":"We had a terrible experience","owner_response":null,"subratings":[],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false},{"id":"716054426","lang":"en","location_id":"11920538","published_date":"2019-10-07T07:28:04-04:00","published_platform":"Desktop","rating":"5","type":"review","helpful_votes":"0","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297547-d11920538-r716054426-EveryDay_Old_Cafe-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review716054426","travel_date":"2019-09","text":"Delicious food and reasonably priced.

в отеле Seven Heaven и периодически ели в этом ресторанчике. Хорошее меню, повара готовят быстро и с душой, по-домашнему. Цены очень гуманные по сравнению с береговой линией. Работают с раннего утра и до позднего вечера. Очень удобно если нужно рано утром поесть. Вечером приятно посидеть в chill out зоне с подушками и попить бедуинского чая. Можно поросить кальян. Персонал очень приветливый и дружелюбный при этом искренне а не наигранно как это часто можно встретить в дорогих ресторанах на набережной.\nУютная атмосфера, среди посетителей много простых и интересных людей из разных стран.

been regulars here whenever visiting Dahab and always had wonderful grilled chicken and lamb. Just in case, the 'lamb chops' are what we would call lamb shanks and they are served baked with vegetables: a true and tasty feast! If you want grilled lamb chops they are called lamb ribs--and are often irregular cuts but marinated and grilled to perfection. BUT this time the waiter insisted we tried some of the other dishes on the extensive menu--and he was right.

It has also a free wifi connection, serves all kinds of beer. The food it good and has a good tast, but is more basic then a restaurant someway further the boulevard. But prices are also less. It also less clean and has more cats around then usual, but not big deal. Don't get me wrong it's not filty, just less clean then big restaurant on the boulevard. For lunch there is no better place to go, great kebab and small dishes!

The meal was genuinely fantastic - I had the lamb koftas and would recommend that, although the rest of the party all raved about their meals. Meal portions are substantial.\n\nThe view from the outside deck is beautiful as it overlooks the bay. The breeze that comes through is a welcome respite from the heat. Seating outside is on large couches, and is very comfy. Part of the charm of the outside dining is that there are cats that wander around and make themselves comfortable on the couches.

\n\nThe chicken curry was also really nice, would have liked more pieces of chicken in the dish but again tasted awesome!\n\nHighly recommend nameste for Indian food if you are in dahab! \n\nOh and it’s super affordable too!","user":null,"title":"Tantalising curry’s full of flavour!","owner_response":null,"subratings":[],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false,"photos":[{"id":"592941601","locations":[{"name":"Namaste Indian Cuisine","id":"10117943","web_url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297547-d10117943-Reviews-Namaste_Indian_Cuisine-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html","intent_url":"tripadvisor:///Restaurant_Review-g297547-d10117943-Reviews-Namaste_Indian_Cuisine-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html","parent_location_id":297547}],"published_date":"2022-05-07T15:55:01-0400","user":{"username":"Unicornbud","member_id":"0","user_id":"5081F95738A4F4D46B51004FA0A9E274","type":"user","avatar":{"id":"23899559","caption":"Unicornbud","published_date":"2010-02-19T14:23:45-0500","helpful_votes":"0","is_blessed":false,"uploaded_date":"2010-02-19T14:23:45-0500","images":{"small":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/01/6c/ad/a7/unicornbud.jpg","width":"150","height":"150"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/6c/ad/a7/unicornbud.jpg","width":"50","height":"50"},"original":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/01/6c/ad/a7/unicornbud.jpg","width":"3000","height":"2250"},"large":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/6c/ad/a7/unicornbud.jpg","width":"550","height":"412"},"medium":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/6c/ad/a7/unicornbud.jpg","width":"250","height":"187"}}}},"helpful_votes":"0","is_blessed":false,"uploaded_date":"2022-05-07T15:55:01-0400","images":{"small":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/23/57/92/21/caption.jpg","width":"150","height":"150"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/23/57/92/21/caption.jpg","width":"50","height":"50"},"original":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/23/57/92/21/caption.jpg","width":"1536","height":"2048"},"large":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/23/57/92/21/caption.jpg","width":"338","height":"450"},"medium":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/23/57/92/21/caption.jpg","width":"154","height":"205"}}},{"id":"592941602","locations":[{"name":"Namaste Indian Cuisine","id":"10117943","web_url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297547-d10117943-Reviews-Namaste_Indian_Cuisine-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html","intent_url":"tripadvisor:///Restaurant_Review-g297547-d10117943-Reviews-Namaste_Indian_Cuisine-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html","parent_location_id":297547}],"published_date":"2022-05-07T15:55:01-0400","user":{"username":"Unicornbud","member_id":"0","user_id":"5081F95738A4F4D46B51004FA0A9E274","type":"user","avatar":{"id":"23899559","caption":"Unicornbud","published_date":"2010-02-19T14:23:45-0500","helpful_votes":"0","is_blessed":false,"uploaded_date":"2010-02-19T14:23:45-0500","images":{"small":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/01/6c/ad/a7/unicornbud.jpg","width":"150","height":"150"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/01/6c/ad/a7/unicornbud.jpg","width":"50","height":"50"},"original":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/01/6c/ad/a7/unicornbud.jpg","width":"3000","height":"2250"},"large":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/6c/ad/a7/unicornbud.jpg","width":"550","height":"412"},"medium":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/6c/ad/a7/unicornbud.jpg","width":"250","height":"187"}}}},"helpful_votes":"0","is_blessed":false,"uploaded_date":"2022-05-07T15:55:01-0400","images":{"small":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/23/57/92/22/caption.jpg","width":"150","height":"150"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/23/57/92/22/caption.jpg","width":"50","height":"50"},"original":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/23/57/92/22/caption.jpg","width":"1536","height":"2048"},"large":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/23/57/92/22/caption.jpg","width":"338","height":"450"},"medium":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/23/57/92/22/caption.jpg","width":"154","height":"205"}}}]},{"id":"832982604","lang":"en","location_id":"10117943","published_date":"2022-03-31T10:45:44-04:00","published_platform":"Mobile","rating":"5","type":"review","helpful_votes":"2","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297547-d10117943-r832982604-Namaste_Indian_Cuisine-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review832982604","travel_date":"2022-03","text":"Absolutely the best!!!

Sinai hike. We will always remember how amazing our experience was at this restaurant and how friendly and hospitable the waiters were. From the moment we went in for dinner, the waiters were at our service and kept checking in to make sure we had everything we needed. The food was just delicious, the portions were generous and the view was beautiful! There were many options to choose from. The decor inside the restaurant was very shabby chic and we both loved it. \n\nOur second night there, we were walking along the street buying gifts and souvenirs and to our surprise one of the waiters called out for us (we’re from Canada and Mauritius and he was saying “Canadian! Mauritius! which was so funny haha) and invited us inside for some ice cream and drinks all on the house! They refused to let us pay and wouldn’t even let us tip! \n\nThis review is long overdue but having dinner at Nemo restaurant is one of our most memorable moments in Egypt and we can’t wait to be back one day. Thank you so much to all the waiters at the restaurant for being so welcoming and kind ❤️ \n\nSincerely, \n\nCanadian and Mauritius ❤️","user":null,"title":"Amazing experience!","owner_response":null,"subratings":[],"machine_translated":false,"machine_translatable":false,"photos":[{"id":"658675347","locations":[{"name":"Nemo Restaurant","id":"1858451","web_url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297547-d1858451-Reviews-Nemo_Restaurant-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html","intent_url":"tripadvisor:///Restaurant_Review-g297547-d1858451-Reviews-Nemo_Restaurant-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html","parent_location_id":297547}],"published_date":"2022-12-09T17:15:16-0500","user":{"username":"NailahR14","member_id":"0","user_id":"F2D95CD123CF95CE195D9C1C3CBAE142","type":"user","avatar":{"id":"452389422","caption":"default-avatar-2020-67","published_date":"2020-02-21T16:07:59-0500","helpful_votes":"0","is_blessed":false,"uploaded_date":"2020-02-21T16:07:59-0500","images":{"small":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg","width":"150","height":"150"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg","width":"50","height":"50"},"original":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg","width":"1200","height":"1200"},"large":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg","width":"450","height":"450"},"medium":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg","width":"205","height":"205"}}}},"helpful_votes":"0","is_blessed":false,"uploaded_date":"2022-12-09T17:15:16-0500","images":{"small":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/27/42/96/93/nemo-restaurant.jpg","width":"150","height":"150"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/27/42/96/93/nemo-restaurant.jpg","width":"50","height":"50"},"original":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/27/42/96/93/nemo-restaurant.jpg","width":"3024","height":"4032"},"large":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/27/42/96/93/nemo-restaurant.jpg","width":"338","height":"450"},"medium":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/27/42/96/93/nemo-restaurant.jpg","width":"154","height":"205"}}},{"id":"658675348","locations":[{"name":"Nemo Restaurant","id":"1858451","web_url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297547-d1858451-Reviews-Nemo_Restaurant-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html","intent_url":"tripadvisor:///Restaurant_Review-g297547-d1858451-Reviews-Nemo_Restaurant-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html","parent_location_id":297547}],"published_date":"2022-12-09T17:15:19-0500","user":{"username":"NailahR14","member_id":"0","user_id":"F2D95CD123CF95CE195D9C1C3CBAE142","type":"user","avatar":{"id":"452389422","caption":"default-avatar-2020-67","published_date":"2020-02-21T16:07:59-0500","helpful_votes":"0","is_blessed":false,"uploaded_date":"2020-02-21T16:07:59-0500","images":{"small":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg","width":"150","height":"150"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg","width":"50","height":"50"},"original":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg","width":"1200","height":"1200"},"large":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg","width":"450","height":"450"},"medium":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg","width":"205","height":"205"}}}},"helpful_votes":"0","is_blessed":false,"uploaded_date":"2022-12-09T17:15:19-0500","images":{"small":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/27/42/96/94/nemo-restaurant.jpg","width":"150","height":"150"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-t/27/42/96/94/nemo-restaurant.jpg","width":"50","height":"50"},"original":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/27/42/96/94/nemo-restaurant.jpg","width":"2160","height":"3840"},"large":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/27/42/96/94/nemo-restaurant.jpg","width":"253","height":"450"},"medium":{"url":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/27/42/96/94/nemo-restaurant.jpg","width":"115","height":"205"}}}]},{"id":"862725920","lang":"en","location_id":"1858451","published_date":"2022-10-01T04:22:10-04:00","published_platform":"Desktop","rating":"5","type":"review","helpful_votes":"0","url":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297547-d1858451-r862725920-Nemo_Restaurant-Dahab_South_Sinai_Red_Sea_and_Sinai.html#review862725920","travel_date":"2022-08","text":"The place has a wonderful sea view.

So far, we have eaten twice in this restaurant, and since it offers such a wide variety of excellent food, we will probably eat in there at least twice more this week! The owner of the establishment was courteous and couldn't do enough to make us feel comfortable; a really nice gentleman. We took our own alcohol with us as the restaurant isn't licensed; this seems to be acceptable in Dahab. So, the total of our check for 2 courses each, plus a complimentary dessert was approximately £35. The meat spring roll was completely misrepresented in its picture in the menu. It was similar to a large long samosa cut into slices. It was delicious. I had moussaka for my main course, and again the traditional moussaka photo in the menu looked nothing like the actual dish (which was the best moussaka I've ever had). A rich meaty sauce with loads of aubergine piled on top; it was amazing. The owner provided us with a complimentary plate of small donuts to finish. The view across the bay and the moonshine across the water were unexpected delights!","user":null,"title":"First Class Egyptian Hospitality (and

Another one to try is the honey garlic chicken as well.

We had Zanooba’s roast duck, which was okay, but didn’t live up to the hype. The setting was nice, small, and intimate. Service, on the other hand, was limited to plopping a heaping clay pot of food in front of us without a word. On the wall next to us was this quote from the Kurt Vonnegut novel Jailbird: “You can't just eat good food. You've got to talk about it too.” Really? They certainly didn't live by that creed. Even though the place was half empty, no one said a word about the food or their slow cooking process. Maybe Zanooba thinks their food speaks for itself.
