The stunning courtyard and French clock tower lead you in to the beautiful interior and ceiling. The chandeliers and the lighting arrangement really make the interior shine. The details and workmanship is so very impressive. Outside you get some impressive views of Cairo city from this side and you can also spot the nearby Sultan Hassan mosque from here. Which you will no doubt be visiting. Also some nice exterior photos can be had here. The area also has a police and military museum but I think the latter is under renovation. A great place to visit and then wander to the other nearby religious sites in the area.",

This Mosque reminded me of the Blue Mosque in Istanbul & I was told later it was designed by the same architect in the ottoman Turkish style . The citadel overlooks Cairo that alone is worth the visit but you also get to see this wonderful Mosque. Muhammad Ali body rest in the Mosque be hind some gold lattice work but unfortunately you only see the lattice work.\nThere is a fee to enter the Citadel if I am reading the ticket right 200 EGP.",

        "text": "The Mohamed Ali Pasha Mosque at Citadel of Saladin, which was constructed to protect the city from the Crusaders, is also called the Alabaster Mosque because of the color of the walls. It was built between 1825 to 1848 by Mohamed Ali Pasha who was the Turkish ruler of Egypt and was designed by the same Turkish architect who designed the Blue Mosque in Istanbul. If you are going to visit and tour the mosque, remember that you must take your shoes off as soon as you enter. They sell a little sock/shoe cover, but you can also just walk around in your own socks. Setting up on a hill overlooking Cairo and being visible from much of the city makes this the most popular mosque in Cairo for tourist to visit, even though it is neither the oldest nor most historic. I agree with another post that said it is more impressive from a distance than up-close. Photos are allowed, and since you are on a hill it provides some great views of the city. (PaM)",

It was a return courtesy to the pasha of Egypt, who had given to France a lavish \"souvenir\" - a 23-meter high and 3,000-year-old stele  which the world knows today as a Luxor obelisk on place de la Concorde in Paris. A slight difference between these two things is that the Egyptian one is still in a great condition but the clock stopped running en route to Cairo - and is still out of order nowadays. Bravo, the French!\nIt is allowed to both film and take pictures inside, no need for non-Muslim ladies to wear a hijab and one may freely enter the mosque once it's not a prayer time - just leave your shoes outside.\nThe view from the hill is great though one can distinctly see heavy smog lingering over the city. If the weather is at least somewhat windy it is possible to detect Giza pyramids on the horizon, however.\nBut, my God, it's so dirty around! Garbage flying, stray dogs lying in the dust, dilapidated houses. Please take note not to unexpectedly face rough reality.",

The mosque, because of its height and prominence near the centre of the city,  is one of the first features that is seen when approaching the city from any direction.\n\nThe inside of the mosque has hints of different religions incorporated within its structure making it really fascinating to look at.",

It was its main mosque, and it was associated with a school (medresa) being a centre of Isma'ili Shia learning and propaganda.\n\nIt was temporily used as a church by crusaders during a short period of internal turmoil, crusaders' and Zankids' interventions, which lead to Fatimids paying a tribute to the Kingdom of Jerusalem and crusaders occupying the gates of Cairo etc.\n\nWhen crusaders were pushed out by Saladin and his uncle sent by Sunni Zankid ruler Nur ad-Din, and Saladin became the Fatimid vizier, he abolished the Shia caliphate, imprisoned the Fatimids for many decades and turned the mosque into a Sunni one.\n\nToday it is therefore a Sunni mosque, and a very important one. The legal opinions of the Al-Azhar University (reformed in late 19th century by Muhammad 'Abduh) are the most respected in the (Sunni) Muslim world.\n\nIt is not, however, the oldest university, or anything like it, as some people here claim. No. The universities are medieval European idea. This was just, like all medresas a school by the mosque, centered around Islamic jurisprudence, and only 'Abduh turned it into a proper university. There were different institutions of learning in the Muslim world, mostly centered around libraries, but these were not universities too.\n\nThe mosque was expanded many times. It is not extremly beautiful, but it's clean and nice, with shining floor, and some decoration by the mihrab and the walls close to it.",

You have to visit the area with a guide. Our guide was Marina; this wonderful young woman showed and explained everything to us  in a very professional way. She was knowledgable, charming, polite and very honest\nThe church is built under Mokattam Mountain, a sacred place for the Copts. It is an open-air amphitheatre where thousands of people can sit down. Under the cave there is a big stage with an altar, icons, etc. Apart from that, a little further there is a proper church too. \nEverything was built by the Copts living in Garbage City, a very poor neighbourhood in Cairo where people pick up all the rubbish in Cairo and recycle it. They cleaned and built the cave and the area, little by little. Fortunately they had some donations, and a Polish artist carved beautiful scenes from Jesus Christ's life on the rock.\nI strongly believe that Cave Church should be a must in any visit to Cairo. And going through Garbage City , although hard to see, is an opportunity to realise how priviledged we are and how much poverty there is in the world.",

But the crowds in there made it hard to enjoy very much. And watch out for the scam artists out front. Two guys (working in tandem?) told us in good English after our car dropped us off, that the museum was closed for 1/2 hour for prayers. One of the guys offered to take us to a nearby covered market. That turned out to be an ordinary souvenier shop. It didn't take too long and we got back to the museum...but just be careful.",

The mummified Pharoahs and high ranking individuals are displayed underground with great sensitivity and honour, and I was very moved by this. Finally, it's at the Cairo Lake, so sitting in the magnificent gardens is a must. Don't come to Cairo and miss this Museum, it is fabulous !",

And with the transfer of many items to the new Grand Egyptian Museum at Giza, the collection is getting somewhat dispersed. The highlight is the Tutankhamen treasures room, which is truly spectacular — and very unique, since most other tombs had been robbed in antiquity. Go there first, especially if visiting at the end of the day. A lot of other very interesting sections, particularly the contents of tombs and some outstanding statues. Allow for two hours. If you can, go to the new Museum of Egyptian Civilization first, because it provides a better chronological explanation of Egyptian history.",

        "text": "Visiting this museum is an incredibly beautiful experience. Located in the heart of Tahrir Square, Cairo, the Egyptian Museum is a unique building designed to host the world's oldest collection of Pharaonic art and monuments, including many must-see masterpieces like the gold mask of Tutankhamun. This golden mask is the most famous of all the artefacts of ancient Egypt, a true icon of the pharaonic civilization. The Mask of Tutankhamun is housed in a darkened room on the second floor amid the vast collection of treasures discovered in the tomb of the young king. There are no photos allowed (as the security regularly yells out) to protect the fragile death mask. The room also contains the spectacular inner coffin of Tutankhamun, along with jewelry and other objects found inside the tomb. The magnificent mask is decorated with semi-precious stones and inlaid with colored glass and gemstones. It is made with two layers of high-karat gold. The tomb of the young Pharaoh it is discovered by Howard Carter in 1925 in the Valley of the Kings in Luxor. Also worth seeing is the Narmer Palette, known as the first historical document in the world – and it depicts the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt in stunning detail. It is also must see in the multitude of artifacts the Statue of Pharaoh Djoser, statue of Pharaoh Menkaure Triad, statue of Pharaoh Khafre, Meidum Geese - known as \"Egypt's Mona Lisa,\" this bold-colored painting depicts an extinct species of goose that lived 4,600 years ago in Ancient Egypt. Then, in room no. 32 on the ground floor, the Statue of Rahotep and Nofret is worth seeing. This realistic life-size statue depicts Prince Rahotep seated alongside his wife Nofret in beautifully expressive detail. Then everyone's favorite, Statuette of Khufu. This tiny ivory statuette is the only intact portrait of King Khufu, builder of the Great Pyramid of Giza. My favorite artifact is the Sphinx of Hatshepsut. As a sphinx, Hatshepsut displays a lion's mane and a king's beard. Hatshepsut ruled as a man, not as a woman, and for this reason her royal protocols and titles are always written without the feminine qualification, which is the \"T\" letter in the hieroglyphic. This is the case in the text inscribed on the base of this sphinx where it is written, \"Beloved of the god Amun, endowed with life forever.\"",

There were over 20 mummies and it was interesting to see the variety and they are all famous, so it’s more meaningful as you travel south on your trip and see their temples. The upper floor also has interesting pieces including the corpse of a body from 35000 years ago! Definitely worth going to, in addition to the Egyptian Museum.  We did not feel a guide was necessary for this museum - there were signs everywhere for knowledge and the time to spend taking in all the pieces is what made it special.  We felt a guide would take that experience away.  Have fun!",

It will be moved to the new Grand Egyptian Museum just before it opens probably sometime this year but no definite date has been announced yet. The Museum of Egyptian Civilisation can most conveniently be visited on the way back to the hotels on the Nile Corniche, and is well worth it. The preserved heads of the most famous kings protrude above the wrappings around the rest of their bodies so you can look into the eyes of Ramases and other kings. There is a walkway right along the banks of the Nile along the Corniche, but crossing the road from the hotels id daunting. No Zebra crossings or bridges. The Pyramids are just outside the town of Giza which has interesting Papyrus museums. There is little to see inside them - just steep narrow passages. Walking (or riding on camels) round them is well worthwhile as is a visit to the Sphinx. There are many other museums in Cairo which also look interesting.",

Firstly the museum is so incredibly busy, I know that I was simply adding to the crowd but wow, there's just so many people crammed in here, and expect to get jostled by the larger groups. There's an additional queue to see Tutankhamun's mask that might make your heart sink a little bit when you see it.\n\nOn the museum's display side it's quite hard to understand the logic of how everything is laid out. It's almost as if with so much to curate the museum has just found space for things wherever it can. Also a lot of the collection is simply unlabelled, and the labels that do exist look very old.\n\nMy honest advice is to decide what you really want to see in advance, and then grit your teeth, brave the crowds, and find  those things with a laser like focus.\n\nHopefully things will be much much better when the new Grand Egyptian Museum opens, and this grand old lady can slip into a well earned retirement.",

Literally millennia of history and monuments.  So much that after multiple trips to Egypt we feel we have only begun to scratch the surface of what is here.\n\nWe came for the history. 1.5kms of Ayyubid Wall that have been restored.\n\nCombine with another site?  \nThe Northern Cemetery --City of the Dead-- is across the street.  A rather fascinating place with historic monuments of its own among family tombs and the poor people living in them now.  A trip to the Park could be combined with a trip to the City of the Dead.  You'll probably want guide for that portion.\n\nIf you are interested in urban redevelopment of the good kind (improving the existing population's life rather than gentrification),  this is a living example of one way to do it.  The story of the project is recounted here.  You can also read about it on Wikipedia or Azhar Park's website.",

As the city is lacking parks and green spaces, this park is almost the only place you can go to. It’s not free though. The entrance fee is 15-20 EGP. The good thing is it’s the same fee as locals, not like other touristy places where the tourists pay the highest fee comparing to the locals.\nWhile you’re there, you might see the newly wed couples taking pictures, which is pretty cool.",

The atmosphere is peaceful and serene, providing a welcome respite from the hustle and bustle of modern-day Cairo. The staff and guides are knowledgeable and always willing to provide additional information about the historical and religious significance of the sites. Overall, I highly recommend visiting Coptic Cairo for anyone interested in exploring the early Christian history of Egypt. Whether you're a history buff or simply looking for a unique cultural experience, this neighborhood is sure to leave a lasting impression.",

Scams are everywhere and the aggressive manner of demanding tips or to buy things is extreme. Overall, if you really want to go see the pyramids, go for a day or two tops. Be very prepared to only go and do what YOU want and not what is “suggested” or forced on you. And be extremely cautious of the Sultan Lotus Oil and perfume palace.

Museum, streets, synagogue).\nI was misled into a “papyrus museum “ that was by no way a museum but a shop for tourists to buy expensive papyrus. Be careful, they don’t tell you anything but put prices in dollars!! 50 dollars for an A4 papyrus. Of course I didn’t buy because i didn’t like the approach and the fact to be misled. I was also taken to a perfume shop (tge guide told me to sit there while he was going to pray). I eventually bought a perfume … but be careful it is again in dollars and you have to bargain a lot and firmly.\nI didn’t like it overall. I bought a cultural tour and felt trapped into unwanted shopping.\nI also didn’t like the familiarity of the guide. I am a woman, solo traveller, over 50, and had the impression to be a piece of meat 🥩.",

You are able to visit the actual site where Joseph and Mary lived for a time hiding Jesus during Herod's slaughter of the innocents. Inside the walls and twisting cobblestone pathways is a large shop filled with the most high-quality souvenirs we found in all of Egypt including jewelry, statutes and Lapis carvings. The store is run as a fund-raising arm to support Christan's locally so guides are not motivated to bring you shopping there and unfortunately, they do not have a website, but rest assured it cannot be missed as it is clearly the largest of the shops.

        "text": "We had a great visit to the churches in Coptic Cairo as part of our Egypt tour with Overseas Adventure Travel. \n\nIt was incredible to see in the Saints Sergius and Bacchus Church the cave where the Holy Family stayed for three months during the Flight to Egypt. The church, built in the 4th century when Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire, is beautiful with stunning icons. There is a lovely latticework through which you can enter the congregation.\n\nThe Hanging Church is so named as it was built over a Roman fortress, which you can see as you approach the church. If I understand it correctly the Hanging Church is the seat of the Coptic Papacy, \n\nChurches have the same design as temples form of temples with the “holy of holies”/altar only available to the priest.  The altar is in a private room that is closed off and in front of the congregation. The priest’s words are broadcast to the congregation. \n\nOur guide being Copt provided special insight into the history and liturgy of the Copt faith and these specific churches. \n\nWhat is especially poignant are the parallels between the ancient Egyptian religion and Christianity. All we learned during visits to the ancient Egyptian temples, tombs and pyramids about rebirth, virgin birth, rebirth from an enclosed stone tomb, three gods; father, son and spirit; son of god in form of a man made the adoption of Christianity by Egyptians relatively easy. \n\nI had always thought that Christianity’s roots were in the Old Testament with the foretelling of Christ in the book is Isaiah. Now I see the deep roots and influence of the Ancient Egyptian religion on Christianity.\n\nIf you have any interest in the history of Christianity, Coptic Cairo is a must see, \n\nAn extra treat was walking by the Ben Ezra Synagogue at the site where baby Moses was retrieved from the Nile. \n\nOur appreciation for Copt Cairo was enhanced greatly by the explanations by our excellent guide Osama Petro.  I strongly urge visitors to do research in the Copt faith and/or go with a guide. \n\nCoptic Cairo is a good respite from the activity and intensity of Cairo.",

There's also a big Carrefour, Cinema, Banks and numerous services. It's one of the 'newer' Malls in the New Cairo area. It's worth mentioning that designer brands and apparel are not available in Festival City Mall. Was pleased to see that the Mall connects to Ikea- (one of my favorite places to wonder in). The best thing about this Mall is the Food Court, which has tons of options. There are about 4 locations for Kids Entertainment, including Magic Planet, a bounce hall and obstacle course-like place. I adore 'The Village' area of the mall, which has lots of wonderful restaurants, (casual, as well as formal) and that beautiful fountain in the center. It has multiple floors and is quite well maintained, except for the toilets, which can be dirty even though they are being constantly cleaned. Everyone should endeavour to visit Festival City Mall. It's one of the best Shopping Malls in Cairo! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼",

        "text": "Cairo festival city had some strange rules that make it very difficult to shop easily:\n1. Today they didn't allow my uber captain to come through the mall car park to my location at one of the designated stops for uber. the uber captain called me and asked that I had to walk completely outside the car park. so I had to carry all my shopping (was large number of heavy bags) as well as carrying my son and walk a very long distance until i reached all the way out of the huge car park. when I enquired at the security at the gate, they said it was the management instructions not to allow uber or careem inside the car park of the mall!! very weird to expect the client to carry all the shopping and walk such a long distance. \n\n2. Once you do the shopping at Carrefour and have all your groceries in the trolley, you are not allowed to shop through the rest of the mall with the shopping trolley. you are expected to carry your shopping bags from Carrefour while shopping through the rest of the mall (eg clothes and getting meals). no trolleys allowed throughout the mall. again very weird logistics that would force you to leave the mall once you do your Carrefour shopping!!!\n\nnever seen any of that in any other mall in Cairo or other overseas countries.",

        "text": "It was a very bad visit to Cairo Festival City Ikea due to employees , they are absent in all sections, the one who happened to help us purchase 3 bedrooms with large wardrobes that need to be designed had a very strange attitude that resulted in that we only let her help us in one design room and we left without completing our purchase, actually I’ll go buy my rooms from another store if this is the attitude at IKEA Egypt. What is very surprising is that 3 years ago we bought 3 rooms for another house and the employees were far more trained and of better attitude. I believe that the employee who helped us needs training.",

People are nice, both indoor shop and outdoor shop and restaurant. \n \n  Less local brand, most are international brand , from LC wakiki, H & M, Zara, Massimo dutti, Ted Baker, Polo Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger,  Gerry Weber, carre four,  debenhams , there should be over 50restaurant I guess and food court , any kind of food you can find here , even Japan, Chinese, Asian. I have been to Sun City mall in March, but bad experience, overall this is my favorite style mall in Cairo. You go without regret. ",

This is a good place to shop for local items, cheap trinkets, and gifts to take back home. You can find local food, spices, cotton products, lamps/lanterns, clothing, jewelry, incense etc. To me as a westerner, I found the market to be very exotic. I was expecting Alladin to pop out from just around the corner!  The place was busy mostly with locals. I enjoyed the sights, and the smell of incense. I did not like the constant hassle from shop keepers to check out their products. One shopkeeper literally asked me \"how can I take your money? \" They are more than happy to rip you off. If you'd like to purchase something you must haggle. Otherwise you will be greatly overcharged. This is one of the things that I hate about Egypt. Nothing ever has a clearly marked price. Locals pay one price, and tourists another as they are constantly charged way more. We are walking bank machines! If you don't like the price of something, simply walk away. If the vendor is desperate enough he will sell you the item at the price you're willing to pay as he doesn't want to miss out on the sale. Have fun shopping and haggling, but be safe as well. Watch out for pickpockets. I recommend for women to carry a crossbody bag in front of you that is slash resistant. I use Travelon's bags, they are great. You will need cash for the market. If you want to bring your credit cards with you, make sure you have a RFD blocking wallet/money belt/purse pocket. As a blond petite woman, I would never go to this market by myself. You will be not only constantly harassed but ogled, and in some cases followed or groped. Try to avoid this by dressing modestly and going to the market with a companion or a guide.",

He said that he's not a tour guide and he just wants to practice his English.\nIt ended like 2 hours later, we barely got out of it, he asked for money in the end, stating \"if you liked my tour, you should give me something\". I was obviously annoyed with him lying from the beginning so we didn't give him any money. He took us to some places which we would not see without him, so that was good. We bought some spices from his companion and ate at a good restaurant he recommended, so I guess he will get a percentage out of it. \nIn the end, it was a useful experience, but if you don't like being lied to or would like some privacy (like we did after an hour), keep an eye out for these kinds of people.\nThe market is huge, hectic, lively, cheerful, we loved it!",

From the general manager to every staff member there was a noteworthy effort made to ensure each guest got the best of service. The food was very good quality with plenty of choice for all nationalities. The different creations with towels and cushions left on our bed by Marco gave us a daily laugh. Abdul our waiter was genuine and a joy  to be served by while Abdul and his deputy along with the chefs kept on top of everything The cabin had everything but was tight and there were plenty of areas to relax especially the top deck. \nAs other reviews note because of the ships docking alongside cabin and dining room curtains are often kept closed with no view of the river which one would expect on a cruise and is disappoonting . \nThe encouragement of some guests of the boat traders with their constant screaming mars the full pleasure of cruisng down the Nile.",

Food was very good all week and staff absolutely lovely, all very helpful.\nHOWEVER the system for paying for drinks is a scam, each time you order anything you have to sign a duplicate sheet with your name and cabin number. What should happen is that you are then given a copy so you can keep a record of what you have spent, however no-one was ever given a copy. When we came to pay our bill at the end of the week there were things on there we had not ordered, such as additional bottles of wine and beers. As we had no evidence we didn't have a leg to stand on and just had to pay.\nAlso if you chose to pay in GBP, they gave an exchange rate of only 23 Egyptian pounds to the pound sterling when the bank rate was 36. I chose to pay on my card in Egyptian pounds but was than charged 4% extra, still better than being hammered with the ridiculous exchange rate. \nPeople we knew were on a different boat and they were given all their bar receipts, be warned this does not happen on the Mojito!",

Everything worked like a well-oiled machine. Transfers were fine, boat accommodation was better than expected, cabins were comfortable and very clean. Food was plentiful with a good selection for all tastes.\nTrips were the highlight; we had 2 Egyptologist’s with us, who split us into 2 small groups. They were both very knowledgeable and had a really good command of English, and the groups small enough to allow everyone to hear the commentary and allow questions from all. The schedule is quite punishing however with many very early starts, but in our view a price well worth paying for all the sights on offer.\nThe only slightly disappointing trip was the Philae light show, the light show itself needs updating.\nOverall an unbelievable experience and we would fully recommend Classic Holidays.",

        "text": "We were very much looking forward to our cruise on the SS Sudan, the early 20th century paddle wheeler where Agatha Christie wrote a portion of \"Death on the Nile\".  The boat is owned and operated by a French tour company, a fact not disclosed in the marketing materials directed at English speakers.  The Egyptian crew struggled with English.  The boat itself is nice enough and reasonably maintained.  However, the food is atrocious for a cruise priced at 800 Euro per person per day.  The same small Continental breakfast buffet was served each day.   The same soup was re-invented an re-cycled each day over a five day cruise.  The entrees ranged from mediocre to inedible.  Left overs were sometimes dressed up and re-served.  The internet, even in the lounge area, is virtually non-existent.  Don't plan on streaming anything while aboard, and you cannot rely on vessel's wi-fi for your phone service.  If you do succeed in accessing the internet, you will be randomly kicked off after a few minutes.  The general manager was absent from the vessel for the first four nights of the cruise, and it was obvious the crew took advantage of his absence by not attending to details such as lighting the candles in the common areas.  A nice touch was the flowers delivered on the first day of the cruise; however, they were already dead and were wilted by the third day.  The upper sun deck is lovely, but only has nine lounge chairs for a vessel that carries 40 plus passengers.  The same passengers staked out the chairs every day but the last.  The ship does have a bar as advertised, but it is not well-stocked.  Order a cocktail at your peril - it will be something very different from what you expect.  \n\nComplaints were either ignored or glossed over by supervisory personnel.  When I was finally able to speak to the general manager on the last day of the cruise, he acknowledged that he was aware of the issues with food and internet connectivity.  He gave me no indication that these issues were being addressed.\n\nThe cruise was particularly disappointing because the land portions of our trip both before, after and while aboard SUDAN in Egypt were first class.  We had no complaints about our day trips from the boat and the guide provided while on the cruise.  Food quality and internet access were not issues at the hotels we stayed at before and after the cruise.  Most tellingly, the food in coach on Egypt Air and Turkish Air on the flight home.\n\nThis could have been so much better with minimal effort and less corner cutting.",

Connected rooms are available.\nThree meals are included, not variable, not tasty but somewhat satisfactory. Water and drinks are not included, you have to pay for them.\nThe pool at the deck is small, it was cold out there so we were not able to use it. \nThe program included evening entertainment (2-3 shows), but this was not true, nothing was provided at the three evenings we spent on the ship.\nAs we asked for the WIFI, the first answer was that it is not free, when we faced them with what they claimed on their website they provided us with complementary  1 GB WIFI during our stay, it was weak at the room but good at the restaurant and the lounge bar. \nCheck out is at 8 am (too early) our guide was to pick us at 12 pm, they only allowed us to delay check out to 9 am.\nIf there will be a next time I will look for another cruise ship even if it costs more.",

There was an excellent whirling dervish and belly dancing show. Food on board, although a buffet, was always delicious and varied. Breakfast was always excellent.

Our Egyptologist Mohamed Shehata was very knowledge, very friendly and made the excursions enjoyable.\nNegatives were the disappointing Afternoon Tea at The Old Cataract Hotel which I was particularly looking forward to.  We were led through the hotel and straight out onto a outside terrace so hardly had chance to take a look at the decor of the inside of the hotel.  The Afternoon Tea was very disappointing.  We had 1 tea bag per person, no teapot and had to ask for milk.  We served ourselves and even had to remove the cellophane from the cake stands which was a bit fiddly. and then the sandwiches were very dry.  Obviously been made a lot earlier on in the day.  The tablecloths had a layer of sand over them as it was a breezy day.  I was expecting a dining experience inside the atmosphere of the hotel, we could have been anyway on that terrace.  \nWe did not receive an evening meal on the first 2 nights of our stay in the Four Seasons Hotel, nor the last evening or the last lunch time of our stay which we would have expected for the cost of the holiday.  We could have at least been offered a light meal on our arrival and departure which would have been appreciated due to the travelling time we endured.\nOverall a great experience though had by us.",

        "title": "Cairo & MS Royal Viking cruise with Mercury Holidays",
        "text": "Pick-up by Mercury Holiday Rep at airport.  Not very organised and was very slow getting out of airport.  Equally slow getting our rooms allocated once we got to the Rameses hilton.  Several of our group went to reception as Rep not being very proactive.  Hotel comfortable.  Drinking water provided in the room.  Beds very comfortable.  Breakfast and dinner provided and were good choice and quality.\nStarted with 1 full day in Cairo with our group and a guide.  Pyramids, Cairo museum, papyrus shop & essential oil shop.  Pyramids very interesting and guide very knowledgable.  Option to do walk into the burial chamber of largest pyramid, (440 egyptian £).  Interesting but is basically a very narrow, cramped, congested corridor with steep up and down sections into the pyramid.  Had to walk some sections with legs and back bent as unable to stand.  Chamber at end contains stone sarcophagus but nothing else, and no art work to see.  \nCould have done without the shops as meant not enough time to properly explore the museum, but I guess this is a feature of most package tours. Lunch was provided and less time could have been allocated to this, but again a feature of group travel.\nNext day was our early flight to Luxor.  Definitely better to have the early flight, even though it meant a 4.30am wake up.  Had the afternoon to relax on boat in Luxor.\nMS Royal Viking  a comfortable boat, although all the dark wood makes it feel dated. \n We had requested a room with double bed when we booked.  Definitely worth doing this as majority of rooms have twin beds. Big windows but only able to open the curtains when boat is sailing, at which time we were more likely to be up on the sun deck.  The way the boats moor at various points next to each other means there is cm between your window and the window of the boat next door, so not privacy if curtains open.\nMeals all included on cruise.  At best the food was very average, and some dishes below this.  Egyptian vegetable dishes were quite tasty, but everything else was basically all very similar taste.  The food was arranged as a buffet and many times it was barely warm, even when we were there at start of the meal time.  I would not have rated the food 5*, (which the Royal Viking says it is rated).\nThe omlettes freshly cooked for you at breakfast were good.\nNo drinks were included, and we would have considered to have drinking water available on the table at meal times, and tea and coffee available at other times should be standard.  Particularly as we were told the tap water on board was not suitable for drinking, and we should use bottled water for teeth brushing.  Tea/ coffee was available at breakfast but other times needed to be paid for.  Several members of our group had packed their own electric kettle, after previous experience of this type of holiday, and I would do this is future.\nWe elected to not pay the additional payment to upgrade to all inclusive  drinks.  This was the right decision.  You would have to be a big drinker to get your money's worth.  We had bought a bottle duty free gin before leaving.  So only paid for the tonic on board.  There is a small fridge in the room.  \nOur guide for the week was very knowledgeable, and always happy to answer questions.  At some sites it would have been nice to have more time to explore on our own.  To explore more in Luxor would have been great but unfortunately Royal Viking has a mooring a long way from the city, although other companies do moor their boats in the city centre.\nOptional trips - We only elected to pay extra for the Abu Simbel trip, and the Karnak temple sound and light show.  Abu Simbel was a very early start and long drive but worth doing for us.  Did notice though that the fact the temple had been dismantled and relocated wasn't mentioned prior to our arrival at the site. This may have changed some people's minds about paying the £100 (GBP) each.\nThe sound and light show at Karnak temple was a waste of money.  Interesting commentary but the light show aspect was very underwhelming.  Save your money on this one.\nWifi needed to be paid extra for, and only available in the lounge bar and reception area.  Not in cabins.  TV reception very staticy and only 1 english speaking channel, but we didn't watch alot anyway.\nSundeck area very comfortable and no problem getting a comfortable sunbed.  We didn't use the small pool but was told it was cold.",

        "text": "We travelled for 7 nights aboard the MS Royal Esadora.  This boat is rated as 5 stars by the Egyptian travel authorities.  It is not 5 star by British ratings - however - they get a lot of things spot on.  \nThe staff are superb, all of them well trained to do their jobs, all of them friendly, all of them effective in their work, all of them willing to assist.  This is a very good starting point for the review.  The food comes next, it's varied and plentiful.  Food is something of a matter of individual taste but I found there to be something for everyone most, if not all of the time.  It was well prepared and well cooked.  To complement the food is the drink, (we opted for the £150 per person all inclusive package) the wine is drinkable, served by the glass at mealtimes.  I preferred the red to the white but it is Egyptian wine not AOC from a better region of France if you follow my meaning!  Water was plentiful and so was Stella beer and Sprite.  Spirits were 'interesting, the gin as OK, the brandy a little tasteless and the whisky has a definite flavour of vanilla!  Folk quickly got used to the different taste of local spirits! The bedrooms now are, as might be expected, smaller than you would find in a city 5 star hotel.  Having said that they are perfectly adequate with enough space to do everything that needs to be done.  Handy sockets for charging phones (with an adapter) and a TV which we didn't use.  The bed was comfortable and the bathroom, whilst bijou, was again perfectly adequate.  The room was kept immaculate by the housekeeping team who dressed the room each day with a sculpture made from towels.  The public areas of the boat were always clean and tidy, again with staff always willing to help.  The Restaurant and bar staff were helpful, and friendly and always keen to please.  There were sufficient sun beds and tables and chairs on the upper deck and the small on deck pool was well used but never crowded.  The evening entertainment was a bit hit and miss, again, individual taste come in play here.  My personal favourite was the Whirling Dervish.  There were two 'Egyptian Evenings' on board where the adventurous dress in 'traditional; costume.  This can be purchased on board or in any local bazar.  We opted of buying some clothing on the boat and were not disappointed with the costumes which was sufficient for both of us for a total of around £35 sterling.  In addition to the clothing there was offers of help to tie headscarves correctly and even apply makeup!  Two of our party used the spa services for a massage and both commented how good it was, the head neck and back massage cost in the region of £35 sterling.\nThe tour guide we were allocated, Ahmed, was excellent, there's nothing more to add to that really.  Good knowledge and care taken with less abled tourists.  He bought the Nile experience to life.  The different tours I don't intend to comment on other than to say that the opportunity to see the sights, many of which have been around for over three thousand years is truly awesome.  Beware the pony and trap drivers, they do like to spice things up with a bit of a race!  Ours badly mishandled things and very nearly turned the trap over - not a good experience - he then proceeded to try and diddle us on the agreed price.  A note about tipping - everyone works hard to get tips, some don't work so hard but still feel entitled, some just ask for money!  This is constant everywhere in Egypt and it is a bit like their selling techniques (and 'upselling' techniques) must start in the cradle - they are very good at it.  Just about everything you buy you need to barter for, they are used to it, we are not which always gives them the upper hand.  If yo don't want to buy, don't make eye contact, and walk on by with a firm 'No Thankyou' if necessary.\nBack to the ME Royal Esadora, we had a great time, and the old adage applies would I go back on board, yes, I would.  The package that we had from Classic Holidays was very competitively priced and it worked well for our group.  Would I use them again, yes I would.  Why only four stars, I believe that there is always room for improvement albeit small improvements.",

A leak was promptly attended to by the maintenance team. \n\nBed linen was changed everyday, which is unnecessary - if you need to cut costs. \n\nWater on the cruise is supposedly pricy so our guide advised us to take our own bottled water. WiFi had to be paid for and was available at the reception and lounge. It would have been appreciated if water and WiFi was provided without charging exorbitant prices, specially \"Water is a valuable resource in both life and in the ways of Islam, and as such, it is considered a great charitable act in Islam to give water to another living thing on earth. Such act is greatly rewarded and brings us closer to Allah\".\n\nThe food was tasteless, reparative and lacked flavour. Eg. The pasta had no salt in it nor garlic, cheese nor seasoning.  It was just boiled pasta tossed in tomatoe sauce/ paste.  The beetroot soup tasted bitter and had an orange flavour. I am sure the orange rind was also squeezed in when making the soup. \n\nDoesn't the chef taste the food before he sends it out? 🤮\n\nI caught a bug and had diarrhoea and the others too complained about unsettled bowels. \n\n",

        "text": "MS ROYAL VIKING should be avoided at all costs.\nI've never felt so uncomfortable and trapped in my life.\n\nDO NOT BOOK THIS CRUISE, the staff, boat condition and attitudes, absolutely wasted what should have been a magical experience.\n\nWe booked this accommodation independently, so we were not part of a group and should have been left in peace to sleep and eat onboard.\n\nYouseff was very persistent on the first day that we needed to have an appointment, I repeatedly stated that we were not interested in buying tours. Then there was a chat about a schedule change, so we had to have a conversation.\nI asked the reception for an updated schedule as we had to get back to Luxor in time to transfer for a flight, he told me he would print it in half an hour when he had no intention of doing so. Every basic question was answered with some kind of excuse.  \n\nI had to unplug the phone in the room as they called to hassle us.  Thinking we were safe from their nonsense, they came to our room and banged on the door until we would open it.  Unbelievable!  All this to try to sell some tours, outrageous!!\n\nOur room was comfortable. \nNeeds some attention such as the double patio doors don't lock (very unsafe on the first floor when you are constantly parked beside other boats). \n\nThe sink is a mess. \nThe hair dryer needs time to cool down, so I had to leave half of my hair wet for 5 minutes until it would work again. \nThe aircon stated it has a heat function, when we arrived it was particularly cool and we were told that the heating doesn't work, we should turn off the aircon and it'll get warmer.  \nWe spent 2 very dull late afternoons and evenings hiding under the extra duvet to keep warm while trying to watch the TV that is badly tuned or has awful reception, either way, unwatchable.  The smell from the bathroom while docked was very unpleasant!  I think it was plumbing odour mixed with diesel fumes.  \nThe stink of diesel, which got so much worse in Aswan, became the reason that we left so early on Friday morning 24th of December. The original booking was until the 27th but we would leave on the 26th to catch a flight.  I had difficulty breathing in the cabin and reception areas and that shouldn't happen!\n\nThe food was boring, with recommissioned variations of the same things.  We never had breakfast on the boat, only 1 breakfast pack as the other time we left so early we were told that it was too early to get a breakfast pack, which wasn't true.  I now know that's because we went on a private excursion and they don't really like that all.\n\nThe food needs attention. It's boring and bland. Neither eastern or western. I needed to cover everything in hot sauce.\n\nThe waiters were filling up bottles of water from used bottles and selling them on to guests. The drinks prices were totally over the top. They served us a beer with tiny plastic water cups at dinner. Came back half way through the meal for a signature. Frankly, it was sad and uncomfortable to be there. We tried to eat outside of the boat whenever possible.  \n\nYouseff informed me a few times that I should pay £26GBP for tips and that it was stipulated in the booking. I've never heard of this before and did not pay it, tips for what? Harassment and bad service?  We left 3 days early because our holiday time is precious!  No apology, no offer of any kind of compensation, they made me write a letter stating that we were leaving of our own free will...seriously!  We all work hard all year to save to come on holiday and that was made even more difficult because of covid.  \nNo one seemed to care about that, they just wanted us to buy heavily inflated tours, drinks and sad photos that we reluctantly had taken.\n\nWe felt like the staff acted as if they were doing us a favour most of the time.\nThis is no five star cruise, 2 at best. It was a sad waste of our precious time and hard earned money.\nIt was my dream to visit Egypt and because of the hassle and constant pestering from Giza all the way down to Abu Simbal, my dream was ruined.  So, so sad! ",

His knowledge was extensive from the small details to the largest. His personal touch was everywhere. We needed something from the pharmacy, he went out of his way to get what we needed. We always wanted to see Egypt and we have all seen the documentaries, but until they are fully explained with knowledge that you do not get except from someone who has lived it. it changes everything and makes it even more wonderful than you thought. This is what Ahmed did. I am from the US and am not a sponsor or anything like that,, Ahmed is just that good and I highly recommend him for your Egyptian Vacation. His whatsapp number is +20 100 099 1026. The cruise itself is good but the stops at all the shrine sites are fantastic . Once again Ahmed made our trip unforgettable.",

We had 12 excursions included and some optionals,  its a good way to visit historic sites and get in some relaxing time too.  We did 7 days.\nFood was all inclusive but at set times.  Felt it was 'tourist food' however there was a good selection of salads, rice, pasta, breads and meat dishes.  Breakfast was my favourite meal. Not all drinks are in the inclusive package, but we felt it was still good value as only another £25 upgrade from the soft drinks package.\nBoat is looking alittle tired but well maintained and very clean.  There are more fancy boats around, not sure if a price difference.  We had a suite, nice size and always good water pressure and hot water in the bathroom.\nThe staff were very attentive and always happy to help.  I had a massage, it was brutal, but very good.  I also felt the oils/creams helped with the sun and dry heat.\n\nWe had an excellent Guide Michael and kept us on schedule.  Be prepared for early starts.  Photos don't do Ancient Egypt justice, it must be experienced.\n\nPro's - Once on aboard, able to relax and enjoy sites, meeting other guests\nCon's - boats can dock next to each other, therefore at times, not able to look outside window.\nSellers are everywhere off the boat, be prepared for repeating a polite No and keep moving lol.\n\nTipping off the boat, Toilets 5 Egyptian pounds \n\nWould we do it again ? Yes we would, go with an open mind, its a fantastic adventure, we loved it.",

Guards and everyone were looking and like typical Egyptian hospitality, nobody bothered or offered to help or allowed car to go.\nCairo is generally a very tourist inconvenient place. We got the same experience here. Nobody knew English. Not mush written for tourists, no guidelines. Even when you are inside there are no directions that where is the exit. There is no place to find out which parts you should visit in Citadel and where are those. Nobody helps or tells you. We visited 2 mosques and then got out. We opted not to see military and police museums. We have no idea if anything else was there. I guess we should've hired a guide for it.\n",

There are supposed to be 4 museums inside but, when we visited in November 2020, 3 of them were closed (just the police museum was open). On top of that the level of maintenance of the place is really poor. There's trash everywhere and a lot of old buildings that are falling apart. They should really clean the place and fix the buildings, including the wooden structures in the main garden in front of the mosque that are falling to the floor. The thing that most disturbed me was that I tried to go to the toilet and I got asked for money to enter. Isn't 180 EGP enough to use the toilet??? It's just unbelievable. The mosque of Mohamed Ali is beautiful but needs some cleaning too. The alabaster is brown rather than white... ",

No doubt the Mosque of Mohammed Ali is beautiful and the view of Cairo from here is pretty interesting but the entry fee really is too much considering that it's almost the same (200 Egyptian pounds) as to visit the pyramids of Giza. In addition to this there were no free restrooms to use inside the complex as the ladies outside the restrooms kept asking for money to use them. One might wanna consider visiting another Cairo sight for this money unless you really just wanna see the Mosque of Mohammed Ali. Then there is no other choice ;).",

The dynasty he founded reigned over Egypt until 1952 when Mr (Comrade?) Naser overthrew it by a military coup.\nAnother moment that caught my eye was a bundle of slackers  - policemen, soldiers armed cap-a-pie as if they were preparing to rebuff an army of aggressors and local tourist officials - all of them doing absolutely nothing but sipping on their tea and lazily checking gadgets of tourists still alive after covid.

Afterwards, the Citadel was used as a military garrison before being converted into a tourist attraction.

However, the main problem for us was the uneven ground and I did notice that in many places that need repair. The buildings including the mosques have the familiar color tinge of Cairo. The Mosque of Muhammad Ali actually looks a deep sand beige and not the alabaster white that it once was. Sand, wind and rain have eroded parts of the buildings. Worthwhile as a place to view the Islamic section of old Cairo. Plenty of sellers and touts are to be found just outside the entrance, so you have to run the gauntlet.",

The historical buildings are a living part of the city. The tourists are the minority after dark, and everything feels so alive. ",

        "text": "The street is named for the first Fatimid Khalifa of Egypt – Muizz l’Din Allah (Strengthener of the Religion of God). The Fatimids—a North African Ismaili Shiah Dynasty--conquered Egypt in 969 AD and developed Cairo as their capital.\n\nThis street ran through the then center of Cairo and later was a major thoroughfare through recent times.  The area around the street features in Naguib Mahfouz’s “Cairo Trilogy” set of novels.\n\nCaroline Williams’ “Islamic Monuments in Cairo: A Practical Guide” is quite useful in providing details on the buildings in this street as well as other Islamic sites in Cairo.  It includes detailed maps.  \n\nIf you can read Arabic, Abbas Al Tarabili’s  ( عباس الطرابيلى )   book “ شوارع لها تاريخ \" has a lot of interesting information on this street as well as others in Cairo. He traces the development of Cairo neighborhood by neighborhood over the years.\n\nBecause the street remained central to Cairo over the centuries, there are not only Fatimid buildings, but also those of successor regimes.  So a good mix of architectural styles.\n\nMosques, madrassas (schools), bemaristans (hospitals), sabils (public water dispensaries), hamams (baths).\n\nYou can buy a combination entrance ticket valid for entry to 10 sites  for LE 100 at the .Qawalun Complex.\n\nThe street is also near other important sites, e.g. Azhar Mosque.  A short walk to Bab al Zuweila, Suk al Khaymiyya, \n\nIf you walk to the end of the street Bab Al Futuh, you will notice a small green dome near the gate.  The Tomb of Hassan Thawq.  A southern Egyptian charged with resolving differences between the young men at the Bab Al Futuh.  \n\nDisappointed with his failure to achieve peace, he packed up his belongings and prepared to return home.  He dropped dead just before the gate and is buried in a small tomb on the right as you exit.  \n\nIt is said that if two or more people in Cairo are fighting, the statement “Hassan Thawq has not left Cairo” will calm things down.  But only if said in Arabic.\n\nOver the centuries Egyptian armies exited to campaigns via the Bab al Futuh and returned through the Bab al Nasr (Gate of Victory) on the right as you exit Futuh.  \n\nThere are portions of the Fatimid and Ayubid walls on the main street outside Futuh.\n\nWell worth a visit.",

        "text": "While settlements close to it (Al-Fustat, Al-Qata'i', Al-'Askar) were the capitals of Egypt since the Muslim conquest in 641, proper Cairo was founded only after the Shia caliphs Fatimids, ruling originally in the Maghreb, conquered Egypt in 969. The conqueror of Egypt was called Gawhar (A Jewel) and was sent by caliph Al-Mu'izz, who soon moved to Cairo as his new capital. That's why this street bears his name. This caliph was also notable for his love of languages. He spoke Arabic, Persian, \"Roman\" (Greek? Latin?) and some black African language, as well as some Slavic probably. \n\nThe street starts with Fatimid walls, with beautiful gates, and there are are many mosques and tombs in the street, the most notable being \n- the mosque of Fatimid caliph (996-1021) noted for his eccentric behaviour and persecution of Christians and, to a lesser extent, Jews. Renovated and nice, with strange minarets. The mosque was started by Al-Hakim's father, Al-'Aziz. The minarets are massive, but the upper part is small and in a completely different shape, because they come, allegedly, from the time of the mamluk sultan Ladjin.\n- the later Fatimid mosque Al-Aqmar. Small but beautiful and interesting\n- the mosque of Qalawun, a mamluk sultan notable for conquering the crusader capital Tripoli in 1289 and preparing an expedition which, lead by his son after his death, captured the capital of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, Acre and the rest of the crusader posessions in Great Syria, apart from Arwad and Cilicia. Strangely, while Qalawun thus defeated the crusaders, his mosque (with medresa and hospital) bears a gothic influence. Do enter inside. I didn't want to do it in 2013-4 because I found the 100x difference between what Egyptians and what foreigners have to pay for entrance apalling. But well, this ticket gives you entrance to some other monuments in this street, and the Qalawun complex is beautiful inside and worth a visit. I visited it in 2018 and was pleased with it. It is also illuminated by night.\n- the mausoleum of As-Salih Ayyub, an Ayyubid sultan, who had a bad choice of dieing just when the crusaders invaded.\netc.\nYou can also buy stuff on this street, but usually not very interesting objects.",

I really enjoyed my time there, so much so, I visited twice in the space of 4 days :D\n\nThey charge 120 egyptian pound for foreign visitors each.\n\nThey have a good baby changing space, wide enough for a toddler. What would make this museum superb is if they had a cafe in the courtyard to feed young children but it seems consistently the case with museums in Cairo. I hope they add this to improve family experiences.\n\n Regardless, the effort they went to maintain the works and stories they share is so magnificient that I give them 5 stars anyway! ",

It’s light and airy now, but like anywhere in the height of summer it’s going to be hot.\nI always recommend this museum to visitors to Egypt, the Islamic history is overshadowed by the pharaonic history but is equally important and intriguing.\nMy only gripe is tour groups who feel that they take precedence in viewing rooms, and their guides who shout so you can’t concentrate, which means you have to rush ahead or dodge them.",

It's not a huge collection and can be covered in a couple of hours while savoring the details of the different artifacts. Highly recommended while in Cairo.",

About the best time to visit; it is open form 9 to 4, we went on a Friday after the prayers and it was not busy at all, I I understood from the workers there that on Friday buses come early and leave by prayers time. The owner of the palace was not only a prince but an artists who painted most of the paintings hanging in the palace and who also designed each corner with a lot of love and passion. A tip: try to read about the owner before you go “Mohamed ali pasha the son of khedive Tawfik” to be able imagine his life in the palace and understand his preferences and artistic taste. \nThere aren’t any food or goodies outlets there so take your bottle of water, sanitizer and tissues. \n\nThe palace deserves a 5 stars ranking , I only gave it a 4 because it needs more care from the ministry of antiquities. More cleaning and may be better lighting. Overall, it’s a must visit place. ",

        "text": "It turned out that there is such a hidden gem in Cairo. A real oasis of silence and greenery, around which beeps, shouts, traffic, dust, debris and crowds reign. The palace was built a little over a hundred years ago under the personal guidance and design of Prince Mohammed Ali Tevfik. The prince was a great fan of the arts and wanted to perpetuate Islamic art. However, he did not choose a specific style - as a result, the ensemble is a whimsical fusion of Rococo, Art Nouveau, Persian, Ottoman, Moorish styles. It is noteworthy that the prince designed the palace not as a personal property, but as an architectural monument.\nEnsemble Manial consists of:\nA 34,000 square meter garden with many rare plants.\nReception palace at the main entrance with rooms for security.\nThe prince's residence. On the ground floor there is a dining room, a fireplace room, several beautiful rooms and salons. The second floor is closed for now.\nThe Ottoman style throne room, on the second floor the Obsidian Hall and the chambers of the prince's mother.\nThe Golden Hall - closed.\nThe palace mosque in the Moroccan style. Very beautiful and richly decorated building with a chic ceiling, decorated with Persian carpets and Turkish blue tiles.\nClock tower.\nThe hunting lodge is a long building with a mediocre collection of hunting trophies.\nA private museum with an extensive collection of antiques and art objects.\nThe halls of the palace are decorated with gilding, stained-glass windows, woodcarving, mother-of-pearl, ceramics and are filled with a huge number of antiques. Entrance ticket - 100 EGP.",

The decorations in the living palace are quite stunning full of wonderful carved wooden decor and beautiful mosaic tiles , the throne room is an eye opener on the last reigning family of princes whom according to their portraits all died quite young, and while the women's quarters were not quite as splendid ( as to be expected). They still provided an interesting glimpse into life in this little remarked period of Egyptian history. \nI really liked the exhibition into the life of the Prince showing not only how he lived but also how cultured he was and some amazing quotes from his works.\nThe mosque was beautifully decorated again with amazing tile work.\nThe last part of the palace which is near the entrance although small is again richly decorated and wonderfully colourful. \n\nAdvice although mentioned as open on Fridays it really isn't the best day to visit as the mosque is open on that day during prayer times to the general public so the rest of the Palace is blocked off. \n\nThere is little in way of written explanation in any language ( excepting the exhibition on the Prince himself) so Either you need a guide or just go and marvel without explanations , as I went with an Egyptian friend the local palace guards told us a bit about each room which was more than enough",

In the main building we unfortunately could only visit the ground floor although I am sure that you have some very nice rooms on the upper floors, including a great view from the tower.... But you can't have it all.\n\nWe saw some nice stuff, but not as impressive as I have seen in other places, still worth a visit though!.\n\nWhat I was not happy about was a guy that seemed to be working as a staff member (not very obvious from his clothes) that started shouting at people telling them they could not go any further in the garden, not even for a small picture, although not so far away from them (and us) there were couples walking/ wondering around.\n\nThe palace really has a huge garden, no clue why we could only visit such a small part. For me I would have given it a higher rating if it wasn't for the bad behaviour of the staff member (really rude, not even to me, but to other visitors, but still... I did tell him that, he seems to forget that it is those visitors who pay his salary!) and well te fact we couldn't really enter the garden... it looked like one in which you can relax for hours......\n\nFor the rooms do go, it is one of the nicer old buildings in town, but don't expect much of the garden.",

Beyond this, there is a throne room (cheap looking architecture) with a second floor above it with 3 rooms in various styles--none particularly worthwhile after seeing the palace building itself.  There is a \"private museum\" which had an exhibit of modern portraits which were not interesting to me.  Then there is the mosque which has a fascinating ceiling with flower-shaped glass skylights inset in carved wooden indentations in the ceiling.  Anyone interested in Islamic architecture would appreciate the palace and the mosque.  Otherwise, I see no reason to recommend a visit to the complex.",

Once you are in it is a different world, reflecting an astonishing architecture. Palace is composed of various quarters. One is the throne hall (where the ministers are meeting with Mohammed Ali, founder of the modern Egypt.Then you may see the main villa (not all are open to public) to admire the finesse of the workmanship, gold and marble (mostly came from Turkey).. Arms museum is a reflection of the Mohammed Ali's hunting hobby. The clock tower in the garden is Moroccan type architecture, covered by tiles from Turkey as well. All in a great garden, called 'orman' (forest in local language) . It is even today well maintained. It takes 34000 square meters.

There are lots of separate buildings in the palace and every time I thought I had seen it all a member of staff would point me in the direction of the next bit. This place is definitely worth a visit and I think they're in the process of renovating the hammam so there might be even more to see fairly soon.There was a bit of a creepy moment in the hunting building as the staff member responsible for it walked right behind me the whole way down the long narrow building, just out of my peripheral vision, which was a bit unsettling (victims in horror movies always hear footsteps behind them just before a grizzly ending - as I say, my imagination was working overtime in that room). I will give the guy the benefit of the doubt though and just assume that he was making sure he was available to answer any questions and simply didn't realise that he was freaking me out!",

It was very special evening but full of tourist scams, we were scammed at the cafe and by one of vendors who sold us magnets, my most authentic experience in Cairo though a tour called \"Food tours by Mila\" search it here on Tripadvisor, true local experience that I will never forget",

We combined Islamic Cairo with the Citadel/Muhammad Ali Mosque, so we were able to discuss a lot of the history while overlooking from the Citadel.\n\nWalking tours are popular, but we chose to only walk at the more popular locations and use a van to take us around, while getting more history about the areas. We also took the tour guides recommendation for a local Egyptian restaurant (yes, we are aware how this normally works, but we were very happy with the recommendation and value- Have the discussion on value and expectations before you agree!).\n\nIt is difficult to get an understanding of the Egyptian people and experience without discussing the history of Islam in Egypt, this is the best place to have that discussion.",

Narrow streets are lined up with old houses. Several famous mosques. Tombs of distinctive Islamic figures. Medieval structures. City walls and gates. The ruins of a Medieval hospital. Interesting family run stores. The route from the Palace Walk novel by Naguib Mahfouz can be followed by the fans of this Nobel Prize winning Egyptian author. I got excited to be able to see the architectural examples of the windows used by women customarily forced to lead their lives only indoor and out of sight. Those elaborate windows allowed them to peak outside while not being seen by anybody from the outside. Starting the walk from the Fatimid gate and walking all the way to and through the bazaar you can finish your exploration sipping a cup of coffee in a cafe near the mosque. It is a shame that the mosques are so inaccessible if you are not a male believer but in spite of that there is so much to see in this interesting part of Cairo.",

The ruins, part of the former Roman fortress of Babylon, are nowadays still visible through a small window in the church’s floor. However, the ruins of another tower from the citadel of Babylon can be spotted between the Hanging Church and the Coptic Museum, located nearby, on the same street.\nThe religious artifacts exposed in the church are antique and of great artistic value. It's like visiting a museum. The icon of Saint Mercurius and the one of Saint Nofer are among the most valuable pieces. Although the Coptic paintings exhibited here look a bit different from the Orthodox paintings of the Greek or Romanian churches, the visitor can detect the Byzantine touch.\nDespite the recent renovation of the entire complex, the time capsule feeling is present. It's like travelling in time to the beginning of the Christian era, somewhere around Jerusalem. The ambiance is so serene, despite the groups of tourists and pilgrims.",

Some historians believe that these remnants are actually the fallen Tower of Babylon. This is not only a tourist attraction but is still an active church and is the official residence of the Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria. The church is noted for having numerous religious works of art with most dating back to the 18th century. The guide of our tour explained the history and importance of the church and why it's called the \"hanging church”. This historic place is fascinating. (PaM)",

Best to go here with a local guide so you get the best of the religious customs and history associated with the mosque. Its also nice to get away from the tourist hot spots. There were a few locals and only a handful of tourists when we visited. Make sure you are dressed appropriately for visiting the mosques: cover up your chest, shoulders, and knees. As a woman I did not need a headscarf to enter, but bring one just in case. Make sure you wear comfortable walking shoes and socks, as you will be asked to remove your shoes before entering. Have a small banknote in Egyptian pounds to hand over to the shoe attendant as a tip. There are a few stray cats that hang in and around the mosques. They look well looked after and friendly. Be mindful of them if you're allergic.",

Then yes, what can be done here which is likely not possible at many mosques of the world (my first such experience among those I've been to) is to go right up above the Mosque where there are actually \"2 parts\": its rooftop with a fairly spacious area to walk around on the four sides (where you can go \"right to the edge\" to see the big square down below); and its minaret which you go up along an \"exterior staircase\" (for some great views of the city to some distances all around including the view of the Citadel located not too far away from this mosque).\n\nSo, it was actually \"4 mosques\" that I visited on the same day with the fourth one (apart from this one, Muhammad Ali at the Citadel as mentioned above & also the smaller mosque just within the Citadel) being the mosque right beside this one which is actually one seemingly \"not in use\" with signs of decay around its small square inside but with its minaret also being one available for going up (a \"tighter space\" to move around at the top of that one though compared to the top of the minaret at this mosque).  And also located right beside this mosque (in the \"opposite direction\" as that to the fourth mosque just mentioned which was actually the third one in my \"order of visit\" just before this mosque) is Gayer-Anderson House Museum which despite its 3-story structure is not much one for impression with a \"dreary look\" from outside (and which is all I saw of it arriving at about their closing time of 3 pm).",

Its inspiration is almost exclusively Mesopotamian as Ahmad ibn Tulun, the ruler of Egypt at the time, came from Bagdad as a representative of the Abbasid caliph.\nIbn Tulun razed the Christian and Jewish cemetery to build the mosque in their place, on top of the hill. The legend says that Noah’s ark had landed here after the flood.  \nThe crenellation above the walls is amazing: it bears a resemblance of human figures with linked arms. It's weird but they seem designed by Keith Haring!\nAnother interesting feature is the minaret, with a spiral staircase on the outside, inspired by the ziggurats of ancient Babylon. Climbing the stairs to the top of minaret worth the efforts as the panoramic views are exceptional.",

        "text": "The Mosque of Ibn Tulun, Cairo, Egypt is the second oldest mosque in Egypt and Africa surviving in its full original form, and is the largest mosque in Cairo in terms of land area. The Mosque of Ibn Tulun was constructed by Ahmed Ibn Tulun between AD 876 and 879 and modeled on the Kaaba in Makkha (Saudi Arabia). Since Ibn Tulun is an open space, it brings in a lot of sun and shadows. Its decorations being created from carved stucco and wood. On the mosque's northern side is the 40-meter-high minaret with a fine horseshoe arch over the entrance and a spiral staircase swirling through the interior.The mosque is an active place of worship. At the time of visiting the mosque women need to cover their heads; arms and legs and all visitors will need to leave their shoes or have shoe covers put over shoes prior to entering the mosque. ",

It is also one of the most ancient mosques in Egypt which is still in its original shape after all the years.

It is not pristine or polished, but its simplicity is part of its elegance. The lattice windows are beautiful.\n\nThe minaret is definitely worth a visit--enter from the \"moat\" inside the mosque's outer wall. Head around to your right when you walk in the main gate, and you'll find the entrance to the minaret there. Partway up the staircase splits, and you can go out onto the roof above the colonnade as well. The view from the roof and from further up in the top of the minaret gives you a sense of the scale of the site.\n\nThe only reason I didn't give the mosque five stars is because the guards had a whole series of buckets that they shove in front of you for donations--for covering your shoes (to be expected), but also for other donations, and then they tell you that what you donate (e.g. 50£E) is not enough (\"more! 100! 200!\"). This is not required--the mosque is free to enter--but it creates an unnecessarily awkward dynamic when trying to enter a sacred space.",

        "text": "Egypt was conquered by Arabs in 641, after a siege of the fortress of Babylon and the construction of the city Al-Fustat under it. Egypt thus remained an Arab province.\n\nThe beginning of Egyptian semi-independance from the caliphs of Islam was due to the governor of Egypt, Ahmad Ibn Tulun, of Turkic origin. He ruled since 868. Not only, while nominally he recognised the rule of Abbasid caliphs in Damascus, he became de facto independant, but also conquered Great Syria (with Palestine) and Cilicia. His dinasty ruled Egypt until Abbasid reconquest in 905.\n\nIbn Tulun created a new capital city of Egypt called Al-Qata'i' north of Al-Fustat and it was destroyed by the Abbasids, but the mosque was spared.\n\nIt is a large mosque, notable for its minaret with spiral steps, which evoke the spiral minaret of the mosque of Samarra, then the capital of Ibn Tulun's overlords, the Abbasids.\n\nApart from that, there are nicely decorated elements, such as the mihrab (the niche showing the direction of Mecca), although this is a copy, the original is in the Museum of Islamic Art in Cairo.\n\nThe fountain in the middle of the courtyard is nice too. The architecture in general is a bit heavy, but looks nice in the evening sun.\n\nWhile the mosque of 'Amr Ibn al-'As, the conqueror of Egypt, which is located where Al-Fustat used to be, is in theory older, it changed its form so many times and it is not so beautiful overall, so I believe this mosque is much more interesting.\n\nThe mosque is a bit apart from the proper Cairo old town as well as from the Christian Quarter and the Mosque of 'Amr Ibn al-'As. It is between them. Therefore, it is not so reknown or frequented, but it's worth a visit. I've been there twice.\n\nAround, there is Anderson museum, but I haven't been there, so I can't comment.\n\nHowever, close to it even is the tomb of Shagar ad-Durr. Not at all reknown person in the West, she deserves attention. She was a Kurdih or Turkic or Armenian slave (but most likely Turkic) and the wive of the Ayyubid sultan Salih Ayyub, who died when the crusaders of St Louis attacked Egypt. To save the country, she concealed her husband's death, forged his signatures and kept the state going until the crusaders were defeated, and the son of the ruler came from far away city of Hasankeyf (nowdays in Turkey). But this stepson was hostile towards her and towards the mamluks (slave-soldiers) who helped to get the crusaders defeated. So he was killed in an interesting fashion, and the mamluks chose a new ruler. They chose Shagar ad-Durr, a women, which was a major scandal, and the caliph of Baghdad allegedly said that if there are no men in Egypt, he can send some from iraq. Shagar ad-Durr was forced to abdicate, but she became the wife of one of the next rulers, Aybak. But when Aybak decided to marry another woman, a princess, Shagar got angry and killed her husband, which got her killed in result.\n\nStill, this unique Muslim woman ruler has a remaining tomb. Not very lavish, but quite nice. Sadly, however, the trash around it is not being cleaned, at least not when I was there.",

It is  interesting to compare this Iraqi influenced mosque to the other mosques we visited in Egypt. It has a huge courtyard that is inspiring both in its space and its features..",

However it wasn’t a must see for me, however if you were booking a tour of Coptic and Islamic Cairo this would be included and in that sense it is worth it.  So I would see if you have some more time on your hands in Cairo definitely go see it but if you have limited time then skipping it won’t be so bad.",

In 1500, Mamluk Sultan Janbalat, anticipating another rebel attack from the mosque, ordered it demolished; however, after three days of unsuccessful demolition attempts on the mosque's southeastern (Citadel-facing) walls, he was forced to give up. In 1517, the very last Mamluk sultan, Tumanbay, took refuge inside the mosque in an attempt to evade capture by the victorious Ottoman army as it took control of Cairo, resulting in the Ottomans bombarding the mosque with cannonballs from the Citadel.\nThese demolition attempts, however, drew criticism from Cairo's population, which subsequently pressured authorities into repairing damages.\nIt is challenging to figure out how this construction impressed the people after inauguration, back in 1363. It is also believed that limestone from the Pyramids of Giza was quarried for use in the mosque's construction. The mosque hosts four Islamic schools (madrassas) and accommodation for their students.\nThere’s a shoes wardrobe at the entrance where the visitors can leave their shoes before visiting the mosque. It’s OK to tip the shoes keeper with 5 Egyptian Pounds for the service. A few kittens were playing around while I was removing my shoes.",

Nonetheless, It has a beauty of its own owing to the creation of its vast spaces. The entry is interesting in that it is angled to channel the air flow in order to keep the mosque cool. Also, this was a Madrasa, or school. There were four schools here each with its own door leading to the courtyard containing the fountain where worshipers washed their hands and feet before entering for prayer. This was a very important school and it is interesting to see how the entire complex was laid out. Don't miss the mosque just across the street.

The mosque is approximately 150 metres in length and covers an area of 7,906 sq. metres (nearly two acres). The walls are up to 36 metres tall and the tallest minaret is 68 metres. The original plan was for four minarets but only three were built and one of these subsequently collapsed reportedly killing several hundred people. Surprisingly the dome is made of wood.\n\nThe doorway where you enter is immense but you then walk through some relatively dark and low-ceilinged corridors until you enter a large courtyard that is shaped as a cruciform with four separate areas for the different schools of thought that surround a domed ablutions fountain. The walls of the courtyard rise up several stories and hold the rooms for the teachers and students. The main prayer area is off to one side of this courtyard and behind that is the mausoleum.\n\nThere is some very lovely different coloured marble in the prayer hall and some ornate woodwork in the mausoleum but overall we did not consider it to be as ornate as the more modern Al Rifai Mosque that is next door and which can be visited with the same ticket to the Sultan Hussan Mosque which cost EGP80 per person.\n\nAlso there were only really two areas to visit here being the Courtyard which had the Prayer Room on one side and the mausoleum.\n\nImmense and historic but I would not consider it to be a must see if you have limited time in Cairo.",

Be prepared to walk a lot to discover what there is, but I'm almost certain you will leave with what you went for. Just look around and you will find everything.\nEven if your not shopping, there is plenty to look at and plenty of places to sit down and unwind.  I just warn you it is pretty loud in there wherever you go.\nPlease join my blog on faceb00k = My Curious Appetite.",

    "description": "This cultural venue, The National Cultural Centre \"Cairo Opera House\" is part of the Ministry of Culture and serves as an umbrella organization for all the music or dance companies, galleries, museums and the educational programs of the Cairo Opera House. It was established in 1988 with the inauguration of the new Cairo Opera House. Its goal is to promote the arts of music and dance and to preserve and renew traditional Arab music. In order to be more than just a place where music and art are performed the National Cultural Centre wants to give space to learning and inspiration, to the exchange of ideas, the respect of a common cultural heritage, and a shared passion for the arts. It encourages interest for music and art in the younger generation by offering ballet, voice or instrumental classes for talented children or youths. Performances of ballet, operatic or symphonic works are staged with Egyptian companies or in cooperation with foreign ensembles or soloists. Seminars and cultural conferences covering a wide range of artistic and intellectual issues are held regularly. Opera House companies are frequently sent on tours to different Egyptian governorates to give the people in urban areas the chance to see national and international art performances. In March 1985, Former President Mubarak laid the first corner stone of the new Cairo Opera House which was to be built with the support of JICA, the Japan International Cooperation Agency. Careful planning by the Ministry of Culture in Cairo and the JICA produced a design suggestive of traditional Islamic architecture and blending in harmoniously with the surrounding buildings. In October 1988,Former President Mubarak and His Highness, Prince Tomohito of Mikasa, the younger brother of the Japanese Emperor, inaugurated the National Cultural Centre “Cairo Opera House” in a remarkable ceremony. It was the first time for Japan to stage a Kabuki show, a traditional popular drama with singing and dancing, in Africa or the Arab World.",

The Child Museum first opened in 1996 to be the first children's museum in the Middle East and North Africa. In 2008, the decision was made to develop the Child Museum and its garden to cope with the highest technology and the latest educational methods. In November 2012, the Child Museum reopened its doors to children. The Child Museum aims at creating an unconventional educational environment, combining activities and museum exhibits together to construct an imaginary voyage through time.

We’re a team of professional guides who’re passionate about travel. And to provide you with a unique experience that you can take away with you. Egypt Tours Club is a passion project for us as we wanted to do something different from the rest. We wanted to provide unique Egypt tours to everyone who loves to travel. Our club was formed in 2014 when our core members decided to leave big-named companies in order to provide you with unique experiences. We’re basically a bunch of friends with each having a vast experience in the traveling industry. We’re trained to provide you with the best tours under the guidance of an experienced GM. You can be a history lover, art lover or a travel lover. We’ll make sure that your Egypt tours are not only memorable but also mesmerizing.",

    "description": "Salam Alikom my lovely travellers. I am an English speaking tour guide and Egyptologist and I am the owner of Moustafa Egypt Tours. We have been organising tours all over Egypt since 2000. I love Egypt and can only tell you what is in my heart and share with you my love for this great land and its people. No matter how often you visit, there is always something new to see and discover. I don't know why this is, it's just the way things are in Egypt. As you drive through some of the busiest streets of Cairo towards Giza, you are surrounded on all sides by honking, bumper-to-bumper traffic, then suddenly without warning you see the Pyramids right before your eyes and you not only know where you are, you feel it too. It is the contrast between the old and new and the ease with which Egyptians bridge the gap that I find most amazing.We offer tours all over Egypt ... we also offer tailor made tours for Egypt.Welcome to Egypt, or in Arabic....
